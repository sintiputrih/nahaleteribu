Facebook’s parent company — whose stock has been slashed by more than half this year alone, shrinking Zuckerberg’s personal fortune — broke the news via email to would-be interns who were due to start at Meta’s London offices in January 2023, a source close to the situation said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This companywide hiring shift is to ensure that our hiring targets are aligned with our highest-priority efforts and business needs.”&nbsp;</p><p>The news comes less than a week after <a href=#>Zuckerberg announced a companywide hiring freeze</a>, warning that Meta has to “plan somewhat conservatively” in the face of an unstable economy. The company is also <a href=#>engaging in “quiet layoffs” by putting thousands of employees on “performance improvement plans”</a> that are seen as a precursor to being axed, Insider reported on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta unveiled its posh new office in the King’s Cross section of London in March when then-Prince Charles toured the facility.</p><p>Meta’s London internships were slated to start in January, while US internships in California and New York typically begin in the summer. Few if any candidates have been offered US internships for 2023 yet — and the future of that program is unclear.&nbsp;</p><p>Beasley did not respond to questions about the future of the US internship program, which has traditionally been a key pipeline of new talent for Meta.&nbsp;She also did not say exactly how many London roles are being affected.</p><p>In August, Meta told its 2022 crop of summer interns that it would postpone making decisions about whether to offer them full-time jobs, <a href=#>Bloomberg reported</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGlmaW1forK1rYyymKejo2K2r8DEq6WsoJmlerCyxZ6prGWZo3qtrdOeqq1lkpq5tXnTop6hrJWjtq%2BzjKamr51f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
