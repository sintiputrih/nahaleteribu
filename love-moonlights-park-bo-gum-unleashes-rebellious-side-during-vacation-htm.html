In fact, one can even say that the 23-year old actor is the exact definition of nice. He is exactly the kind of guy girls can take home, introduce to their parents and expect a warm acceptance.</p><p>That's just how he is. Just one look at Park Bo Gum and the trust comes out naturally. With his boyish charm, politeness and humility, it definitely isn't hard to understand why people would only expect good things from him. Park Bo Gum is so nice that he had even admitted how difficult it was for him to play a mischievous character.</p><p>In a report made by Allkpop, Park Bo Gum sat down with Ten Asia for an interview and one of the topics that had come up was his good boy image. The Love in the Moonlight star revealed that his father played a rather significant role in shaping his enviable personality.</p><p>"My father used to tell me that 10 minus 1 is 0 which means that it doesn't matter if you are good at all times because one single mistake can easily break you. I don't force my good boy image. I've been living like this for 24 years so there is no pressure when it comes to my good image."&nbsp;<span>The actor said during the interview.</span></p><p>Those are some good words to live by. However, while he is known for his high-class and "won't hurt a fly" image, Park revealed that he also had a bit of a "badass" side to him and that he unleashed it one time during their well-earned vacation in Cebu, Philippines.</p><p>"Everyone went to Korean restaurants to eat as instructed by our travel agency. But I really wanted to try the local food at a Filipino restaurant since we traveled far, that is why&nbsp;<strong>Kwak Dong Yeon</strong>&nbsp;and I went to a local restaurant&nbsp;without telling our guide instead."&nbsp;<span>The actor confessed.</span></p><p>Ten Asia was definitely surprised but it definitely wasn't because of the actor's confession but more on with his perception of the word badass. They would go on to say how "pure" Park Bo Gum is but nonetheless, he still had so much fun with his little "rebellion" if you can call it that.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rLzOqaqtmaKve6S7zGiYq6yZmLmmv45rbm1uZ2l8c3yQb2hpamdkubDCxGakqKeeobaotNOsZKmZoqB6o7uMoKymZaWjuaat0qGcrGWimq%2BmuMuipq6rXai2pbGMnayroZ6ceretwpqroqeeY7W1uQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
