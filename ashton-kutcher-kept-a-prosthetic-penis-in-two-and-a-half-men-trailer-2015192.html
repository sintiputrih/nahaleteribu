"In the very first episode that Ashton was in, there was a point at which he was supposed to drop trou and be completely naked in front of me. We didn't know how to do that in front of the live studio audience without him actually being naked, cause the whole point was, it was supposed to shock people."</p><p>"We said, 'We're gonna have to cover him up somehow, but it still has to be shocking,'" Cryer continued of Kutcher, 37, who was brought onto the show after <strong><a href=#>Charlie Sheen</a></strong>'s exit. "Everybody was trying, people were working this over in the writers' room, and then Ashton pipes in, 'Oh, I've got a huge prosthetic penis in my trailer!' We all had that awkward moment of 'Of course you do!'"</p><p>New dad Kutcher seemed unfazed by the anecdote, exclaiming, "Doesn't everyone?" He went on to explain to O'Brien why he had the surprising item in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>"You too can have one made," he told the comedian. "I had these web shorts that I did for my company and we were producing these various web shorts, like hidden camera things. One of the things that we did was this sketch called 'Naked Man.' We had this guy and we had him put on this prosthetic unit, and we sent him to interesting places… I was like, 'Who knows when you're gonna need a prosthetic penis?' So, I kept it and I just happened to have it around."&nbsp;</p><p>After that, Kutcher settled in easily with Cryer. He went on to do four seasons of Two and a Half Men, which is airing its series finale on Thursday, Feb. 19.</p><p><a href=#>Asked by Extra</a> what he will do with all of his free time following the show's wrap, Kutcher said, "I probably will spend a lot more time with my family and friends, and that would be nice for a good while."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The That '70s Show alum recently started a family with his fiancée <strong><a href=#>Mila Kunis</a></strong>. The gorgeous star welcomed the couple's first child, daughter <strong>Wyatt</strong>, on Sept. 30.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm going to miss his daughter Wyatt because he brought her to the set for the first time last week," <a href=#>Cryer spilled to Extra</a> about completing filming. "She's a little bit of a diva. She poops in her pants and expects other people to clean it… that’s not cool on-set behavior as far as I am concerned."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJisoKSku2631K2aoZ2iYrimvNNmmGaooqTAtbTEraCcZaCau6q%2FjKKlZqynpHqiusNmmGagkaGzbrnEp2StqpGeuaa%2BjGtnam1hbn9w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
