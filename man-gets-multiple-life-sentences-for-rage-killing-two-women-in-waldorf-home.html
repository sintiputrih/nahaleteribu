Several neighbors and witnesses also reported to hearing gunshots about a half hour before the grisly discovery.</p><p>The investigation into the murders found that Watkins supplied marijuana to Niravanh, who then sold it off in Southern Maryland.</p><p>Before the fatal incident, the pair got into a argument over texts about an alleged debt, where Watkins also expressed dismay that Niravanh was attempting to contact his drug supplier directly and skipping over the middle man.</p><p>That text exchange included a voice-to-text message that showed Watkins threatening violence against Niravanh.</p><p>According to court documents, on the morning of the murders, Watkins drove his Honda Accord to Nirvanh's home, which she shared with Garrett, and killed them both.</p><p>Following the fatal shootings, prosecutors said that a vehicle matching the description of the Honda was caught on camera leaving the area, leading to his apprehension.</p><p>Watkins was convicted following an eight-day trial of:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Two counts of first-degree murder;</li><li>Two counts of use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence related to the murders of Niravanh and Garrett;</li><li>Use of a firearm during the commission after being convicted of a crime of violence.</li></ul><p>At sentencing, Assistant State’s Attorney Jonathan Beattie called the incident a “rage killing” and asked for the maximum sentence under law. He furthered, “the callous disregard for human life is appalling” and that Watkins’ actions were “heinous, angry, and vengeful.”</p><p>Judge James West added that the incident “was an execution with no purpose other than to say, ‘I was crossed on a business level or I was disrespected.’ This shouldn’t be tolerated in any community.”</p><p><strong>Want breaking news in the DMV as it happens, or want to contribute?
