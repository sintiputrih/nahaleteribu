While his parents watched his procedure from the viewing room, their son was up in Heaven, meeting his unborn sister and looking down at them praying.”She looked familiar and she started giving me hugs and told me she was glad to have someone from her family up there,” Colton <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>says</a> of the encounter with his sister. “She doesn’t have a name though, she said they never gave her one. But she can’t wait for her mom and dad to come to Heaven to meet her.” Incredible.His parents, who says their son looks “dead serious” when he describes what happens to him, were once again shocked when Colton says he saw his great-grandfather, “Pop,” who had died 30 years earlier. But, Pop wasn’t an old man. Colton said he recognized him from a picture of when Pop was young. Interesting thought.Colton, now 11, says his visions became more clear as time went by. “I remember Jesus,” he says, “there’s streets of gold and a lot of colors. I sat on Jesus’ lap and then I just felt safe. God, he is the biggest one in Heaven, he can hold the world in his hands.” Who also mentioned that everyone has wings and can fly, except for Jesus, who hovers up and down.Sonja, who is a teacher, initially had her doubts about Colton’s vivid &nbsp;recollections, but local pastor Todd insists: “I am convinced he was in Heaven.” Now the Burpos have released a book about Colton’s experience called Heaven Is For Real, which has sold more than a half a million books and is a New York Times <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Best Seller</a>.</p><h3>–Leigh Blickley</h3><p id=content-paragraph-2><strong>Get more </strong><strong>HollyBaby news and gossip!
