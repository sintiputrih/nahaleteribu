It speaks of a sudden shift in a relationship, as the protagonist realizes that everything their partner had said was just a lie. The mention of Jersey getting colder symbolizes the changing dynamics and the emotional distance that has crept in.</p><p>The lyrics in the chorus also reflect the protagonist’s struggles to hold on and find strength amidst the pain. They express the hope of becoming stronger and being able to move on, even if they feel broken beyond repair.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Verse_1_and_Verse_2></span>Verse 1 and Verse 2<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The verses of the song delve into the idea of finding solace in music and the power of a song to evoke emotions. The protagonist suggests writing a song that they can dance and sing to, emphasizing the therapeutic nature of music. It’s as if they want to find refuge in music to help them cope with the difficulties they face.</p><p>Verse 2 takes a deeper dive into the impact of a particular person, who not only ignites a spark but sets everything on fire.
