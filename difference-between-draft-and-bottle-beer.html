Is it better to choose a draft or bottle? Although there are many lager-style beers that are virtually identical depending on the packaging, there are generally subtle differences between draft beer and bottle beer that can make all the difference. Understanding the finer points between these two popular beer options can help you pick the one that best fits your needs.</p><h2><span id=1_History>1. History</span></h2><p>According to culinary historians, draft beer has been around much longer than bottled beer. Draft beer was originally served at beer halls straight from a wooden or metal barrel, vat, or keg; however, bottled beer was introduced in the 1700s. Home brewing was popular during this time, and it created a need for a sturdier packaging option. Bottles were more resilient than traditional serve-from-directly-from-a-barrel options and provided a method of transporting homemade brews from place to place.</p><p>Once efficient bottling operations had been established, the roots of modern-day beer packaging had effectively been carved. Nowadays, it is just as common to purchase a bottle to enjoy outdoors, as it is to order a draft glass in a bar; yet, the slight variations between the two linger on.</p><h2><span id=2_Packaging_Process>2. Packaging Process</span></h2><p>In many cases, brewers make minor tweaks to the beers they package in bottles or cans versus the ones they distribute as drafts. This is due to the stark differences in the brewing and carbonation process required for each type of packaging. Draft beer generally contains more carbon dioxide because of the simple force carbonation method; this leads to a more robust and robust head, usually higher carbonation levels, and a smoother drink. Bottle beer is usually bottling conditioned, meaning additional sugars and specific types of yeast are added before capping. This affects the bottom-fermenting process, resulting in a flavor that can be slightly more complex.</p><p>Bottled beer may also contain additives like caramel color to provide a consistent look with each batch. These same additives are not needed for draft beer because any flaws are generally negligible considering the quick turnaround time in serving it.</p><h2><span id=3_Nutritional_Value>3. Nutritional Value</span></h2><p>A big difference between draft and bottle beer comes down to nutritional value. One 12-ounce serving of draft beer typically contains 148 calories and 0.5 grams of fat, while a comparable serving of bottle beer contains 153 calories and 0.7 grams of fat. Both are comparable but differ slightly due to slightly varied brewing processes.</p><p>The differences between draft and bottle beer also play a role in nutritional value; fresh beer often contains more B vitamins than the bottled variety, though, it does contain fewer polyphenols due to the additional filtering process for bottled beer.</p><h2><span id=4_Freshness_Factor>4. Freshness Factor</span></h2><p>One of the most appealing differences between draft and bottled beer is the freshness factor. Keg storage ensures draft beer keeps its fresh taste for roughly two months, while a bottle rusts off its freshness after about two weeks. To keep draft beer from losing its appeal, establishments must rotate kegs more frequently; this provides drinkers with the best draft product possible. When you pick up a bottle from the store, you don’t need to worry about the freshness since most beer stores will rotate their stock daily.</p><p>Ultimately, the freshness factor depends on the brewer, the mass production or micro-brewing process, the bar owners’ level of care, the integrity of the distribution system, and other factors that can really impact freshness and shelf life. Moreover, some bar owners prefer to store their kegs at lower temperatures than what is required for bottled beer, which can give the draft beer a more robust flavor.</p><h2><span id=5_Variety>5. Variety</span></h2><p>Bottle beers tend to have a wider variety of styles, flavors, and colors than draft beers. Beer aficionados can gain access to a larger breadth of styles when going for bottle beer, as brewers can experiment with more obscure and complicated recipes that retain the ideal flavor and texture when bottled. With draft beer, the sampling of flavors tends to gravitate toward popular styles and flagships, which may be much more limited compared to their bottled counterparts.</p><p>Additionally, keg storage is much more expensive than simple bottle conditioning, so making “crazy” beer styles might not make financial sense for the typical brewery. As a result, it is much easier to find unique and specialty variety when reaching for a bottle than a draft.</p><h2><span id=6_Temperature>6. Temperature</span></h2><p>The temperature at which you serve draft and bottled beer is slightly different. Draft beer is, on average, consumed at a temperature ranging from 38 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit while bottle beer should, ideally, be served at 45 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit, or a bit cooler. The extra bit of warmth enhances the mouthfeel, beer aroma, and hops character that emerges after popping off the bottle cap.</p><p>In the end, it all comes down to personal preference. Some people may prefer a colder glass, while others relish the extra nuances found in a slightly warmer serving temperature.</p><h2><span id=7_Glassware>7. Glassware</span></h2><p>To get the best beer drinking experience, the proper glass should accompany bottle or draft beer. Branded, specialty, or standard glasses may be used with bottle beer, but the pour size can range from 4 ounces all the way up to 20 ounces. Draft beer should always be served in a glass, but the size and shape can vary according to the brewery and the specific style of beer served.</p><p>The biggest takeaway when trying to decipher between a draft and bottled beer glass is to pay attention to the size. Draft beer standards are more strict concerning glass dimensions, with the standard pint glass looming over the often wider and taller 5 to 7 ounces glasses most breweries serve bottle beers in.</p><h2><span id=8_Carbonation>8. Carbonation</span></h2><p>Draft beer and bottle beer are carbonated differently, according to size and carbonation model. Standard bottled beer is usually force carbonated, usually using pressurized CO2 to force-push the gas into the beer; this process is faster, cheaper, and requires much less time than the typical keg beer, which is “naturally” carbonated. As a result, draft beer typically contains higher CO2 levels and a thicker, frothier head that is often referred to as “tight” or “closed.” Plus, except in rare cases, one should never have to wait long for a draft beer to “open” he fizz upon serving.</p><p>Bottle beer is much smoother, as the carbonation bubbles are sealed inside the bottle, and released gradually. As the beer is served, the gradually increasing pressure forces this same carbonation up and out of the botte’s necks, resulting in smaller and less lively bubbles with a much less characteristic head.</p><h2><span id=9_Cost>9. Cost</span></h2><p>In general, draft beer tends to cost less than bottled beer due to the lower cost of purchasing and storing kegs, canning and bottling expenses, transportation fees, and other touches that affect the cost of bottled beer. There are certain beers that may be cheaper depending on the store, however, but in general, draft beer is the economical choice.</p><p>Also, depending on your beverage of choice, you may be able to get a liter (33.8 ounces) of beer “on tap” for a smaller cost than buying two bottles equivalent in volume. Additionally, when ordering draft beers in establishments, you can generally get a cheaper price in a smaller glass versus a full pint at a bar.</p><h2><span id=10_Quality>10. Quality</span></h2><p>The quality of a beer depends on the packaging process, freshness, and brewer’s techniques; as a result, both draft and bottle beer can supply superior quality depending on the beer and brewer. Draft beer might club a longer shelf life, giving it more room for oxidization and further age, but this does not necessarily amount to a better tasting product. Most of the time, draft beer is meant for immediate consumption, which helps keep its superior quality intact, but this does not always carry over to its bottled counterpart.</p><p>At the end of the day, it all comes down to personal preference and the beer at hand. There are many differences between draft and bottle beer, yet, each offer a unique drinking experience that can change with the season and circumstances.</p><p>In summary, draft and bottle beer have different histories, packaging processes, and nutritional values which can lead to a difference in freshness, variety, temperature, carbonation and cost. Understanding these subtle differences can help you choose the right beer that best suited to your needs and preferences.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCwyJ%2BdnqqVo7CmecGeq7CdlaN6pb7An6tmmZ6ZeqO7062jnmWSmrKzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
