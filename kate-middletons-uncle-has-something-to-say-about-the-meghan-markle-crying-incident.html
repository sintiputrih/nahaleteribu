"I don't believe for a moment that Kate made Meghan cry," he said. "I've known Kate since she was born and she doesn't have a mean bone in her body. It's just simply not in her nature."&nbsp;He added that the mother of three — who's <a href=#>married to Prince Harry's brother, Prince William</a>&nbsp;— is "even lovelier on the inside than on the outside." Goldsmith suggested the story reported in the tabloids may have been more accurate than what Meghan Markle told Oprah Winfrey. "If anyone had a hissy fit, it must have been Meghan. Kate would have been trying to make the peace," he suggested.&nbsp;</p><p>Kate has not publicly addressed the claims, though <a href=#>Buckingham Palace issued a statement</a> a few days after the interview aired. "The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan. The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning," a statement read, per <a href=#>The Guardian</a>, highlighting <a href=#>an allegation about the color of Archie's skin</a>. It added, "While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately." The palace also noted that the trio&nbsp;"will always be much-loved family members."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG5pZYRze8qaq55lnZ6xpbjEraanq12qu6S4xGafmqtdqLyusdOhoKefXam8br%2FAsmSamp%2BqwW7Ax55kpp2Xna6vecyaqaSklWKws8XIp55moZ6YtqWxza1m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
