She wanted a boy so he can be mama’s boy forever — that sort of thing. We’ll see if I can deliver, I don’t know. She’s like, ‘You go see if you can hit a clutch shot. You gave me all girls, let’s see if you can bring a boy!’ Nope, not yet. We’ll see.”</p><p>The Philadelphia native told<a href=#><strong> Jimmy Kimmel</strong> </a>in October 2018 that Gianna wanted to continue his legacy on the basketball court and had WNBA dreams.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In October 2019, he gushed to The Los Angeles Times about <a href=#>his athletic daughter’s “curiosity on the court.”</a> He said that Gianna was “something else,” explaining, “Even in a heated situation in a game where it’s going back and forth, she can detach herself and come to me and ask a very specific question, which is not common. She’ll come over and say, ‘OK, on this particular trap when I’m trying to close the gap but she’s getting on the outside, do I need to change my angle?’ It’s a very specific question. That’s pretty damn cool.”</p><p>The Mamba Mentality author wed Vanessa in 2001.
