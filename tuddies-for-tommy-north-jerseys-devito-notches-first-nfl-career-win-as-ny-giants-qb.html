It wasn't always pretty, but the Cedar Grove native and Don Bosco grad threw 246 yards for three touchdowns, despite being battered behind a beleaguered offensive line that allowed nine sacks."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"The decision was made since this level of football is stressful for a rookie, especially from the quarterback position. There is a lot going on, a lot of meetings. So everything outside of football is handled by my family."&nbsp;</p><p>DeVeto once again captured the nation's eyes on Sunday when he celebrated a Saquon Barkley touchdown with a little Italian flare.</p><p>After going undrafted, the New Jersey native is earning approximately $44,000 per week after signing a contract worth upwards of $2.7 million, though it is not guaranteed. Meanwhile, Jones signed a four-year $160 million contract with $92 million guaranteed, according to <strong><a href=#>Sportrac</a></strong>.</p><p>DeVito is the son of a hard-working plumber, Tom, who has made headlines all his own after being spotted in the stands <strong><a href=#>questioning calls</a>, </strong>and mom Alexandra, who continues to take care of her son - and touting his success - even as he's become a household name.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving forward, DeVito looks to be in the driver's seat running the Giants' offense after Taylor was placed on the Injured Reserve list.</p><p>In his <strong><a href=#>ESPN interview</a></strong>, DeVito was both joked about by teammates and praised for his intrinsic knowledge of Northern Jersey.&nbsp;</p><p>"I've been over there. I love going to his spot," fellow rookie Wide Receiver Jalin Hyatt mused about his parents' place. "He has a little hot tub in the back. The crazy thing about it is he lives, maybe, 15 minutes away. So he's close."</p><p>Offensive lineman Ben Bredeson also boasted about DeVito's Jersey swagger.</p><p>"When I came out here, that is what I thought a New Jersey guy was," <strong><a href=#>he said</a></strong>. "I love Tommy. Absolutely love Tommy. He's got, obviously, a loud personality. But he's always fun, always having a good time. He's just a very self-confident guy, and not in a bad way."&nbsp;</p><p>With his "Rudy" story now complete, the only question left is who plays the New Jersey native in the feel-good movie.&nbsp;</p><p class=e-click-here-follow-btn data-testid=bottom-paragraph><a class=e-email-signup js-follow-button data-testid=article-click-here-to-subscribe href=#>Click here</a> to follow Daily Voice Bergenfield and receive free news updates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmickZ65usLOopqeZpOkunC6xLBko52iqLK6e8GeqaCdnpu2prjDaKuunJSesrR5xaipZqyforq6ec2oqa2gXZ%2Bys7%2FEsqpmnJWrtrW7jKemrZuYmsBussirqq1lnpu5bq%2FAq5yeql2stq95wKxkp7FdnLaiutOsZKqaXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
