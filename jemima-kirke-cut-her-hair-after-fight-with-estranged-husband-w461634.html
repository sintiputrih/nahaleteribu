I felt like my hair was my go-to trick,” Kirke, 31, told self-acceptance blog </span><i><a href=#>StyleLikeU</a></i><span> in a video shared on January 17. “I really believed for a while that without it I would be boring.”</span></p><p><span>The </span><i>Girls</i><span> actress continued, “I was having a terrible moment with my husband in our relationship, and I was extremely hurt by him and extremely angry at him, and so I was feeling self-destructive. But for whatever reason I didn’t do something self-destructive, really, I just cut my hair.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jk-e4e84eb5-ae88-4702-a49a-9fc6b8619207.jpg><p>And she didn’t stop there. After unveiling the major change <a href=#>via a Twitter video</a> in October 2015, Kirke decided to keep going — and this time, she handed the scissors to Mosberg. “I said I wanted to go shorter, and he said, ‘I’ll do it,’ and he cut it,” the actress and artist explained in the clip. “It was really nice. It was kind of romantic. It’s nice to have someone you love cut your hair.”</p><p><span>Still, Kirke acknowledged that there was tension with Mosberg, with whom she shares a daughter, Rafella, 6, and a son, Memphis, 4. “It really makes no f—king sense, me and him together, but actually [it’s] a pretty fascinating relationship for both of us because we do love each other so much,” she said.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/3c36695e00000578-4128834-image-m-19_1484680110330-6b32d3ac-cc32-4f22-90d3-dbc08f01b5c8.jpg><p><i>Us Weekly</i> <a href=#>exclusively confirmed</a> earlier this month that Kirke and Mosberg split.
