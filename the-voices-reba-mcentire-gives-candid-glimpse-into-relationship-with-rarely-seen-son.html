He's always striving to be better. His daddy did a great job too." She paused, searching for the right words before adding, "Shelby is a gift from God to me. We're incredibly close. Before Shelby, I was a tad self-centered. But his presence shifted my focus—it became about nurturing, loving, and teaching this wonderful life I was entrusted with."</p><p id=eDHxqmrF5GWy data-wc=27>Juggling the demands of a thriving music and television career with motherhood wasn't easy, but Reba managed with grace and determination.
