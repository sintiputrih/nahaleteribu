Although this tragic occurrence has been a tough one to handle, Thomas shows bravery and generosity through her work, especially as she plans to start a new segment on "Today" called <a href=#>"Dear Bobbie,"</a> in which she'll offer guidance to others in need of advice.</p><p>Along her journey of healing from her loss, Thomas has received guidance and backing from her kindhearted colleagues. Speaking to <a href=#>People</a> on March 3, Thomas revealed that Hoda Kotb is one of the people who has helped significantly as she's grieved her husband's death. "There are moments that I feel horrific guilt for how fortunate I've been to have such a support system; to have a work path that connects me to other people, especially people like Hoda," Thomas said. "Throughout this past year off camera, I can't tell you the number of times out of the blue, I have received texts personally from [her]."</p><p>She went on to state that Kotb is a "dear friend" who has been there for her through it all. It's inspirational to witness Thomas' resilience that has been made possible through her own strength and the loving support of good friends like Kotb.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcHBobIJ0e8GomZuhlWLBqbvMmqpmm5%2Bjs6q%2BzKxksKCRqXq4sYysrKyolZjBprCMmqOlZZGhvK%2BzjJqZqK2kYrWwsMBmoqiskmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
