The celeb, whose real name is Rob Van Winkle, told <a href=#>CNBC</a> in 2012 that his house-flipping business is just as lucrative as rap was for him back in the early '90s, and he's been chronicling his work on "The Vanilla Ice Project" on the DIY Network. "They're both pretty good, to be honest with you," he said of his current cash flow compared to when he was a rapper. "The great thing is I found another passion that does make money."</p><p dir=ltr>Vanilla Ice went on, "The short sales, the foreclosures are great, but tax auctions are even better," adding, "If no one's bidding against you and it's an absolute auction, you can steal the homes for pennies on the dollar." He said that, in addition to making green, his houses go green, too, telling <a href=#>DIY Life</a> in 2020, "We create less of a carbon footprint. We use a lot of LED lights. ... We installed a tankless water heater outside. It costs less to run, and you never run out of hot water."</p><p dir=ltr>The star&nbsp;<a href=#>even wrote a book</a> on how to get rich flipping houses, which, he said, he got into by accident. Vanilla Ice apparently bought an apartment in New York City's elite Greenwich Village, as well as a property in Los Angeles, in his early 20s, but sold them because he was never home — and made a sweet profit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW1lZX5wr8SlnJurXZq7pbHDZquorJGhubp50Z6erqSRp3qru8GsZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
