Music has been the main source of her wealth.</p><h3>Meg White Net Worth $20 Million</h3><p>To begin with, Meg White grew up in an area of Detroit with her parents and her sister Heather. In the early 1990s, Meg White worked as a bartender in a restaurant in Detroit, where she met the musician and songwriter John Anthony Gillis. The two formed a band named The White Stripes. It has been unclear for a long time whether they were a brother and a sister. or they had a relationship,but it was later revealed that they were married and then officially divorced. Yet they continued calling each other brother and sister during performances. Their first album was entitled “The White Stripes” (1999) and was released by Sympathy For The Record Industry as well as the following album “The Style” (2000). The third album was called “White Blood Cells” (2001), which was first published by Sympathy For The Record Industry but later reissued by V2. The album was known for several modest hits, like “Hotel Yorba”, “Dead Leaves And The Dirty Ground” and “Fell in Love with a Girl”. The following album “Elephant” (2003) was even more successful, and won a Grammy Award for the Best Alternative Album of the year, and the song “Seven Nation Army” was awarded as the Best Rock Song of the year; the album was named the 390th best album ever by Rolling Stone.</p><p>Moreover, Meg White alongside Jack White starred in the film “Coffee and Cigarettes” (2003). In anticipation of their fourth album the White Stripes released a live DVD “Under Blackpool Lights” (2004) which was certified gold – it is the compilation of two concerts in Empress Ballroom in Blackpool, and included a single “Jolene” by <a href=#>Dolly Parton</a> which was a huge success. After this great success, “Get Behind Me Satan” (2005) was released, which was well received by critics and audiences, due to hits like “Blue Orchid” and “My Doorbell” (nominated for a Grammy Award). The album was again awarded a Grammy, as the Best Alternative Album of the year. The seventh and final album by The White Stripes was entitled “Under Great White Northern Lights” and was released in 2010. In the beginning of 2011, The White Stripes announced that they had decided to end their activity, largely because of Meg’s anxiety, which effected her ability to perform.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of the musician, Meg and <a href=#>Jack White</a> were married from 1996 until the middle of 2000; after their separation Jack took her last name. In 2009, she married the guitarist Jackson Smith, the son of Fred “Sonic” Smith and <a href=#>Patti Smith</a>, but the two divorced in 2013.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=29.242196878752><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Meg White</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 10, 1974</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.66 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Musician, Drummer</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Jackson Smith (1996-2000), Jackson Smith (2009-2013)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Parents</td><td>Catherine White, Walter Hackett White Jr., Seven Nation Army, Icky Thump, Fell in Love With a Girl</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Heather White</td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/thewhitestripes</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.32142857142857><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/jackwhiterocks/?hl=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm1353108</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.26229508196721><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/meg-white-mn0000628461</a></td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Awards</td><td>Brit Award - Best International Group (2004), Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album, Music Album, MTV Europe Music Awards for Best Rock (2003), MTV Video Music Award for Breakthrough Video (2002), Shockwaves NME Award for Best Single (2004)</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Albums</td><td>“The White Stripes” (1999), “The Style” (2000), “White Blood Cells” (2001), “Elephant” (2003), "Get Behind Me Satan" (2006), "Icky Thump" (2008), "Gossip in the Grain"</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Music Groups</td><td>"The White Stripes" (1997-2011)</td></tr><tr readability=12><td>Nominations</td><td>American Music Awards for The White Stripes - Favorite Alternative Artist (2007), Brit Awards - Best International Group, Best International Album, Grammy Awards - Album of the Year (2004), Kerrang!
