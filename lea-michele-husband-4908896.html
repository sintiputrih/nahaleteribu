Is this happening?'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The couple got hitched in March 2019 and Lea has regularly showed off <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>epic photos</a> from the special day in various posts on social media, especially on their anniversaries.</p><h2>Zandy has his own successful career.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Zandy, who grew up in Philadelphia and attended the University of Philadelphia, co-founded the clothing company, AYR, which stands for “All Year Round,” in 2016.
