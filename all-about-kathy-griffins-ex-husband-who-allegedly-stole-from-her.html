She said he would sneak into her wallet in the morning when she was asleep and take her ATM cards to withdraw money. She was unable to see past the trust issues,&nbsp;so&nbsp;she filed for divorce in 2005.</p><p style=text-align:justify>So who's this guy anyway?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matt-moline-was-on-kathy-griffin-my-life-on-the-d-list>Matt Moline Was On 'Kathy Griffin: My Life On The D-List'</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The Bravo&nbsp;reality show is about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kathy Griffin's wacky journey from being a D- to an A-list celebrity</a> in Hollywood. It aired from 2005 to 2010. So the ex-couple's journey from being married to filing for a divorce, attempting to reconcile, and&nbsp;officially&nbsp;getting divorced are all there. In short, Moline&nbsp;had always been known for his relationship with the comedian.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Whose Careers Started On A Reality Show</a></span></p><h2 id=he-was-in-the-oh-malleys-in-daddy-s-my-mercedes>He Was In 'The Oh-Malleys in Daddy's My Mercedes'</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Haven't heard of that movie? Well, even IMDb doesn't have much information about it, but it's apparently Moline's most recognized work aside from his role in My Life on the D-List. The movie was produced in 2008, just two years after his divorce from Griffin was finalized. There's really nothing much to say about his work here since the movie doesn't even have an&nbsp;IMDb rating.</p><h2 id=he-was-sort-of-a-struggling-software-entrepreneur>He&nbsp;Was Sort Of&nbsp;A Struggling Software Entrepreneur</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Matt Moline was a software entrepreneur at that time he allegedly stole from Griffin. And according to the comedian, he took money from her bank accounts for 18 months. Either Moline was just really greedy and has spending issues or he was really struggling in his business or career. Griffin didn't say anything about that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Caused Kathy Griffin’s Ongoing Feud With Andy Cohen?</a></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Moline only had this&nbsp;to say</a> about the public revelation of his actions:&nbsp;“Since our divorce, I have not made any public comments about my ex-wife or our marriage. It saddens me that she would choose to make such accusations at this time. I have no intention of engaging in a public debate over private matters.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>So we're never getting confirmation on what really caused him to allegedly steal from Kathy Griffin. He's also been somewhat off the grid since the divorce, so nobody really knows what he's been up to. What's important is that Griffin is finally in a&nbsp;better place in her life and&nbsp;is now in a loving marriage.&nbsp;Of course, we hope the same for&nbsp;her&nbsp;ex.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kathy Griffin Throws Severe Shade At Johnny Depp In Support Of Amber Heard</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYpaRdlq%2BwwdNmopqsmK56qL7In52ipqNisrl5x66qm5memXq4tM5mmKWklZyypbjYZqqtp5yaeqe%2BzqZkoZ2iZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
