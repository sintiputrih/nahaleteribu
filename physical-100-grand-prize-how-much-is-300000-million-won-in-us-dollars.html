Such challenges included pushing a 1.5-ton ship across an arena filled with sand, being the last one standing holding a giant heavy rock above your head, and pushing a 200-pound boulder over a hill again and again until you can’t any longer.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>Although many of the show’s contestants included CrossFit athletes, Olympians, MMA fighters, gymnasts, and bodybuilders, not all hailed from similar athletic backgrounds. Contestant Cha Hyun-seung was a dancer and model, Bbulkup was a YouTuber and restaurant owner, Elaine Yuki Wong was an actress, and Lee Min-woo was a chef.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>Indeed, diversity was the name of the game for Physical 100. Regardless of age, gender, or race, anyone was allowed to compete, and anyone had the ability to take home the 300,000 million won cash prize, and what a coveted cash prize it was.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-the-us-dollar-conversion-of-300-000-million-won data-injectable=false>What is the US dollar conversion of 300,000 million won?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>Reality competitions are famous for offering contestants cash prizes. That said, something about Physical 100’s cash prize stands out as impressive. Perhaps it is the “million” attached to 300,000 million won. It sure sounds like a lot, but is it worth as much as it sounds in US dollars?</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>The exchange rate between US dollars (USD) and South Korean won (KRW) has been in constant flux due to multiple periods of inflation in South Korea. As of 2023, $1 USD is officially worth 1,303.426 KRW, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a>.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=false>That means the 300,000 million KRW cash prize from Physical 100 is actually worth $243,188 USD, according to <a href=#>Netflix</a>. That’s still hefty prize money for a competition that’s in its first year of inception. Should the hit show get renewed for a second season, it wouldn’t be surprising if Netflix upped that amount.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yxtNisoJyZnGJ%2BcXyMoKmappRivbO12Z5koaenYrq2r8dmoKxlY2V9cXyPZqSipJyevK951qilZqGeYsK0ecOoo6WZoqh8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
