While he wasn’t there physically, she felt his support on the big day and has in the years since she’s been with Evensen.</p><p>“My dad’s always just loved me, and it’s not been something we talk about. I think it’s really hard for people who are Christian and do have that belief that marriage belongs to a man and a woman. But when your daughter falls in love with someone and you love that person, you can’t just say you don’t believe in it.”</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=false>She also said she didn’t want to put words in his mouth but that she’s always felt love and support from her father.
