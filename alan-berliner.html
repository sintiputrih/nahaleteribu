On a personal level, he struggled with insomnia most of his life leading to a domino effect of painful challenges associated with always feeling tired and zombie-like. His relationship with late evening hours is conflicting because on one hand, it’s the time of day he’s most tortured struggling to fall asleep tossing and turning in turmoil, however, on the other hand, it’s the time he feels most invigorated and creative allowing him to create all of his films. As a result of this, Alan created all his films in the night.</p><p>On his latest film, First Cousin Once Removed, see the article by María del Rincón, Efrén Cuevas and Marta Torregrosa, "The Representation of Personal Memory in Alan Berliner's First Cousin Once Removed", Studies in Documentary Film, 2018, vol. 12, n. 1, pp. 16-27.
