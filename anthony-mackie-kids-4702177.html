They dated on and off until their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>secret marriage</a> in 2014, which wasn’t revealed until a year later! The couple got hitched at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic in front of about 150 people.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Although very little is known about Anthony and Sheletta’s brood, due to their private nature, it has been reported that they welcomed four children together before calling it quits in 2017. And despite never mentioning them by name in interviews, Anthony does give fans a peek into their lives here and there.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“The most rewarding part [of fatherhood] is seeing them grow up to be good human beings, really nice kids,” Anthony told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Fatherly </a>in July 2020. “I try to impress on my kids that the world is their playground and that they should respect people as human beings until they’re shown otherwise,” he added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Anthony-Mackie-Sheletta-Chapital.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>After the arrival of his third child, the actor revealed how a big family has changed his view during an interview with the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Los Angeles Times</a>. “I recently had my third kid, and it just messed up everything that was my reality. It just changes your entire perspective on the world. Even traveling is an issue now — I’ve got to buy five tickets! I look at my parents — they had <i>six</i> kids. I always wondered why we never took vacations further than Florida or the Gulf Coast — it’s like, “Oh, because they couldn’t afford eight plane tickets, so you just put all the kids in the Lincoln and drive to Florida!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>In a video interview with<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Vanity Fair</a>, the 42-year-old star recalled the moment his son found out he was Captain America. “It’s an opportunity to spend more time with your kids,” he explained. “It’s been a way for my sons and I to bond over movies.” He went on to say that as a parent, “all you want is the approval of your kids, and to him, nothing or nobody else matters. My son said it was cool, so it’s cool, you know?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>While we may not know much about Anthony’s kids, we can agree with them that their father is definitely “cool”!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Cnq6Gnnq56rq3CpKCeZZuesbR5k3Bna2lnbHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
