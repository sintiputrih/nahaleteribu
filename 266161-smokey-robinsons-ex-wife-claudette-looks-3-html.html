Fans always have one or two words to compliment her via Instagram when the classic hitmaker posts updates. Less than 24 hours ago, she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.instagram.com/p/CQOrwzMJxe9/>shared</a> a clip with the caption<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CQOrwzMJxe9/>:</a></p><p class=dh>"I'm cooking Seafood Gumbo over on my Youtube channel.
