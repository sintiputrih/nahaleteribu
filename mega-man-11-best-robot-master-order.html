It has eight Robot Masters, all with their own unique stages awaiting the player when they start a new game.</p><p data-injection=true>For the casual player, though, choosing which Robot Master to fight first can be a little daunting. How do you know which Robot Master weapon is the best to get first? What are their weaknesses? And what’s the hardest stage of them all?</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>The 10 best classic series Megaman games, ranked</a></p><h2>Best Robot Master routes in Mega Man 11</h2><p data-injection=true>With so many different options, we’ve decided to offer a small sample of suggestions on how to tackle the eight Robot Masters, depending on your skill level and preference.</p><h3>1. The Standard Route</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/megaman-11-block-man.jpg><p data-injection=true><strong>Order</strong>: Block Man, Acid Man, Impact Man, Bounce Man, Fuse Man, Tundra Man, Torch Man, Blast Man</p><p>Acid Man has arguably the most challenging stage in the game, and he’s one of the more annoying bosses due to his Acid Barrier ability. You don’t want to fight him first because he’s hard to deal with when you only have the standard Mega Buster. Keeping this in mind, pick up his weakness (Block Dropper from Block Man) in the first stage so you can get an annoying stage and boss out of the way early.</p><p data-injection=true>Bounce Man’s stage is equally challenging, but it’s more irritating due to the amount of bounce-related puzzles that will make your thumbs numb before long. Thankfully, this order works out well to get him out of the way in the early stages of the game. The route is also aligned so that every proceeding boss battle is weak against the weapon you picked up, making the whole game a breeze.</p><h3>2. The Masochist Route</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/megaman-11-fuse-man.jpg><p data-injection=true><strong>Order</strong>: Acid Man, Bounce Man, Torch Man, Impact Man, Tundra Man, Fuse Man, Blast Man, Block Man</p><p>Why would you try to make things easy on yourself when you can dive into the deep end immediately? This route starts with some of the hardest Robot Masters and stages but ends on a more pleasant note with the easier ones. It also sets you up to be less likely to have a weapon that’s weak against another Robot Master for some time. Don’t expect any hand-holding here. Whip your Mega Buster out and get to work.</p><h3>2. The Chill Route</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/megaman-11-tundra-stage.jpg><p><strong>Order</strong>: Blast Man, Block Man, Impact Man, Bounce Man, Fuse Man, Tundra Man, Torch Man, Acid Man</p><p data-injection=true>This order gives new players time to get used to the game and learn the controls before taking on some of the more difficult stages. Blast Man and Block Man’s stages are relatively easy and won’t require anything that’s too strenuous. There are a few instances where you won’t have a Robot Master’s weakness (such as Blast Man or Impact Man), but these fights shouldn’t require much extra effort. This route also puts the more annoying stages at the end so that casual players don’t quit before they’ve had the chance to get used to the controls.</p><h2>Final Boss Fight order and tips on how to defeat them</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/megaman-11-wily-encounter.jpg><p data-injection=true>Regardless of the route you choose, you will have to face the last few&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Megaman 11 bosses</a>&nbsp;in a specific order, just like how it is with other games. In Megaman 11, you’ll face Dr. Wily two times, with a different form each time — the famed Yellow Devil and Mawverne.</p><p>Here are the recommended weapons you can use against each of them if you want to finish the game without much difficulty. But if you want to make it more challenging, you can simply avoid using these weapons:</p><ul><li><strong>Yellow Devil:</strong> Chain Blast (from Blast Man)</li><li><strong>Mawverne:</strong> Bounce Ball (from Bounce Man)</li><li><strong>Dr. Wily (1st Form)</strong>: Acid Barrier (from Acid Man), Chain Blast (from Blast Man)</li><li><strong>Dr. Wily (2nd Form)</strong>: Acid Barrier (from Acid Man), Scramble Thunder (from Fuse Man)</li></ul><p>Capcom designed the Megaman games so that bosses can be defeated using nothing but the Blue Bomber’s Buster. Using the weapons he attains with every win, however, makes it easier to finish the game.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3cf17256d4ca65e3d7804402b0e49939?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Adam Newell</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc></p><h4><a href=#>More Stories by Adam Newell</a></h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qK3Mnqeuql6YvK57xq6gnZ2jZLqms8BmpJqmXWZ%2Bbq7ErKtmqp%2BXvLV5zJqqrZ2iYryzsMSr</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
