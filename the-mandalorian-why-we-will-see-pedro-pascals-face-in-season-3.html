 The Mandalorian season three is the show that all Star Wars fans are talking about right now. After a long wait, the story of Din Djarin and his little son Grogu has hooked us all over again - but fans have been speculating about how much we will see of the lead actor, Pedro Pascal, in the show. 
Pedro’s character almost always wears a helmet, but we have caught glimpses of him without it in previous seasons."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, the early storyline in season three - which saw him declared an Apostate by the Children of the Watch for removing his helmet and only being able to redeem himself after bathing in the Living Waters - &nbsp;meant that he wouldn’t be allowed to remove it again under any circumstances, appearing to shut down any hope we had of seeing Pedro’s face in the show.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Din removes his helmet in The Mandalorian</figure><p id=eAJXbnaDyxT data-wc=42>However, Bo-Katan Kryze appeared to change everything in the eyes of the clan’s Armorer after admitting that she saw a Mythosaur in the water while saving Din. This legendary creature upon sighting was said to bring in a new age of Mandalore.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/127bdd9b9e64-swthemandalorians3teaserdigitalkav6lg2d688011.jpg><p id=eWWJQV326zZ data-wc=59>As such, the Armorer allowed Bo-Katan to remove her helmet and walk “both ways” to unite the Mandalorian clans and unite them once and for all. However, since Din is the wielder of the Dark Saber, which technically makes him the leader of the Mandalorians - who is to say that he won’t be able to do the same?&nbsp;</p><p id=e88LSd-cXt data-wc=9><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>What viewers thought Star Wars spinoff series Andor</a></p><p id=e_IZ-8FNAg data-wc=13><strong>MORE: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>23 best Star Wars gifts to surprise film fans on May 4th</a></p><p id=env8xnSK0H5 data-wc=67>Speaking about making both The Last of Us and The Mandalorian to Empire, Pedro appeared to hint at more than voiceovers for his character, saying: “[Producers] Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni are creatively not limiting themselves to the way things are normally done. We’ve improvised making myself available for whatever they need. I hesitate to reveal anything because I don’t want any plot surprises to be spoiled.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a65bef6171b0-screenshot-2023-04-03-at-113528.png><p id=eZGYqYT5tcPZ data-wc=75>The star also spoke about how much he dislikes wearing the helmet, adding: “It’s like putting on a head-to-toe glove with weights on it. Ironically, you can’t see any facial expression because it puts you in the world so completely, and instantly makes the character feel real – but you can’t see [expletive]. When it’s on, you immediately feel powerful, protected, dangerous, and like a protector.” Albeit a ‘protector’ who can’t see where he’s going.”&nbsp;</p><p id=ekalD9SfH_B data-wc=26></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
