We co-parent, and we can’t even do that. It’s very difficult.</p><p>“I would honestly say this is probably the worst that it has been in our relationship, because we don’t really communicate because he won’t communicate. It’s hard to be dealing with the court stuff, not communicating, having children, my son’s getting ready to start school, so that’s kind of where we are.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50 Cent Helps The Late Pop Smoke Win An Award, Dedicates It To Pop Smoke’s Mother</a></span></p><p>And while many people were confused about her relationship with Lil Fizz, whose real name is Dreaux Pierre Frédéric, Jones said that the 34-year-old had provided for her in ways that Omarion never did.</p><p>Fans may have had their opinions about them dating, but Jones remained adamant that she had known Fizz for years prior to starting a relationship with him, and that their decision to date wasn’t to spite Omarion by any means.</p><p>“My relationship with Dreux, he’s definitely someone who I always considered just like an angel sent into my life. I’ve known him for some years, but we’ve definitely gotten closer over the last two to three years,” she continued.</p><p>“He has been there through the course of just the sh-t that I deal with with the father of my kids, just helping me in that aspect. I’m a single mom, I have no family in L.A.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It’s awesome to be able to have a friend who chooses to do what’s right, to be there and support his friend, to make sure that I’m healthy mentally and honestly, he’s just an angel sent into my life. I’m just truly honestly grateful for him.”</p><p>Then, in February 2020, while Omarion had mostly been tight-lipped about his ex-girlfriend’s relationship with Fizz, who she ended up calling it quits with just a month prior, explained to Big Boy TV that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he doesn’t share a friendship with his former bandmate</a>, adding that they hadn’t talked in a while.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50 Cent Slams Jeezy On Instagram, But Backs Down After Losing The Diss War</a></span></p><p>"I don't have a relationship with Fizz," he revealed. “But I think there should be an opportunity for us to talk one day. I don't know when that is.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 36-year-old had spent the last couple of years working on his fifth studio album, The Kinection, which was released in October 2020, so while Jones and Fizz were making headlines over their relationship, Omarion was busy putting together his first record in six years.</p><p>The “Entourage” hitmaker plans to get back on the road next year in support of his latest release while putting the drama and issues with Jones to the side. After all, he shares two children with her and doesn’t see himself holding on to things that have happened in the past.</p><p>Perhaps now that Jones and Fizz have called it quits, Omarion’s relationship with his ex will heal so that they can be the best co-parents to their children.</p><p>As for Jones, while she's no longer seeing Fizz, she claims that they've remained close friends, stressing that their romance never ended on bad terms. They had just grown apart and realized they were better off as pals.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Love & Hip Hop’s Moniece Slaughter Survives Near Fatal Car Crash</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmpqaZop68r7%2BMnq9mn5mnuae%2ByJ6lnWWcmrO1eceipGaen6d6qbXSZpmeq6Ris7O1xKebZqSZoXqntdmzZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
