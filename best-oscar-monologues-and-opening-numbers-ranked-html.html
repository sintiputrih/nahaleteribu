He will prick Hollywood excess, genuflect to Meryl Streep, and deliver a few zingers pegged to the Best Picture nominees. Oscars preparations are a secret, but we know he’ll do this because, over most of the last 65 years, televised Oscars shows have just about always featured a host doing just that. (Well, okay — the Meryl Streep jokes date back only to the late ’70s.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5yic1300233b6165jh7is7@published data-word-count=49>While no one was looking, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recently dumped most of its Oscars footage onto YouTube — hundreds and hundreds of clips from the show, including virtually every opening monologue, a mind-blowing treasure trove you can have a lot of fun picking through.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5yibyt00223b61wkqb2th6@published data-word-count=125>What follows is a ranking of those opening segments, from worst to best, with a lot of great jokes along the way. A lot of the shows had a single host. Bob Hope was of course an early Oscars favorite, hosting 18 shows. (<a href=#>Here’s Billy Crystal’s tribute to him at his death, in 2004</a>.) Johnny Carson hosted five, in the late 1970s and early ’80s. Once in a while there was no host, or a series of hosts, a big dance number, or even weirder stuff. For our purposes here, I stuck to whatever happened before the first award was handed out. The only things missing are a few of the celebrated Chuck Workman film collages, which aren’t on YouTube, I assume for rights reasons.</p><h2 class=youtube-headline itemprop=name>How Far is Hollywood From Achieving Equality?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5yibyk00203b61ed5h8l3b@published data-word-count=59>As we came close to the present, I discovered as well that some monologues were missing from the Academy’s YouTube channel (like Seth MacFarlane’s notorious opening) and some were expurgated, like Chris Rock’s remarks on The Passion of the Christ. (“Not that funny, really.”) That’s okay — all of the recent shows are readily available on the Pirate Bay.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5yibym00213b61h5eu92gc@published data-word-count=7>So here we go!

There’s a terrible host, and great movies like Life of Pi, Zero Dark Thirty, Amour, and Beasts of the Southern Wild are beaten out by Argo, a movie about a trivial sidelight to a geopolitical tragedy abetted by the United States for decades. (The actual story was so uninteresting that director Ben Affleck had to add a lot of spurious suspense, like the fictional oh-so-dramatic plane takeoff at the end.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5ykyvo002v3b61es5yzijs@published data-word-count=21>Anyway, we have the host from Maxim, Seth MacFarlane, whose stint left a bad taste in a lot of people’s mouths.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5ykyvo002w3b61inn06kur@published data-word-count=90>This is for a few reasons. One is that most of his jokes sucked. Mentioning Daniel Day-Lewis’s Method acting as Lincoln, he asks, “If you bumped into Don Cheadle on the lot, would you try to free him?” Django Unchained, he says, “is about “a man fighting to get back his woman, who’s been subjected to unthinkable violence. Or as Chris Brown and Rihanna call it, a date movie.” Why would Rihanna call it that? And this is the Oscars, not the Grammys. Even his Mel Gibson joke was off.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5ykyvp002x3b61hd7mrwf6@published data-word-count=73>There is a dance break with Charlize Theron and Channing Tatum, during which MacFarlane croons “The Way You Look Tonight.” This Fred Astaire classic conjures up memories of the swellegant Astaire and Ginger Rogers that the galumphing Tatum and Theron quickly dispense with. And when Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Daniel Radcliffe come on to join MacFarlane for another dance number, the trio’s raw magnetism rivals that of some of the early Academy president speeches.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5ykyvp002y3b61bntwgjh5@published data-word-count=121>Then there is MacFarlane’s song “I Saw Your Boobs,” which is presented on tape after a video chat with William Shatner as Captain Kirk, ostensibly beamed in from the future. The song, in case it isn’t clear, mentions a lot of actresses who have done nude scenes in movies.<br><br>There’s a big double standard when it comes to nude scenes in film; it would have been a great opportunity to riff on that and cinema’s exploitation of women generally. But MacFarlane is just sniggering. No subtext, just sniggering. Hey Seth: You saw Jodie Foster’s breasts in The Accused because her character was being gang-raped. Captain Kirk was right about one thing: You were the worst Oscars host in Academy Award history.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cje5zhguf003i3b61dpd9lixv@published>65. 2011 (the 83rd Oscars)<br>Hosts: James Franco and Anne Hathaway</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zibsy00413b6153l6tzih@published data-word-count=56>Hathaway gets the better reviews — and I know, I know, she’s an angel — but let me tell you, neither is very good. Franco is simpering when he wasn’t distracted, and while Hathaway brings a bit of spirit, most of her lines are only half-funny. It is the longest four minutes in Oscars opening-monologue history.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zinv800493b61snr411uy@published data-word-count=24><strong>Best Line:</strong> Hathaway introduces her mom, who tells Hathaway to stand up straight and push her chest out a bit. “Steven Spielberg is here!”</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cje5zi43p003o3b61lqfseg6a@published>64. 1974 (the 46th Oscars)<br>Host: Burt Reynolds</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zjhl8005e3b61r6fzhqlw@published data-word-count=86>In the 1970s, things occasionally got weird at the Oscars. Tonight, there is a fanfare of nominated songs. It’s an incredible year for movies, including The Sting, The Exorcist, American Graffiti, The Last Detail, Paper Moon, and, not least, Last Tango in Paris. Then, we get a seven(!)-minute dance by Liza Minnelli, climaxing in two vignettes. In the first, she relives her Best Actress loss for The Sterile Cuckoo … and in the second relives her Cabaret win! Minnelli’s a star, but it was rough going.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zjuyk005x3b61z28fqpwe@published data-word-count=92>Then comes Burt Reynolds, the most ill-suited host before James Franco. The highlight here, really worth checking out, is a wonderful collage, coming in at about the 20-minute (!) mark, sort of an Oscars blooper reel. But the rest is just Burt Reynolds, known at the time for displaying Elvis Presley–level acting chops in a series of unaccountably popular movies with titles like Gator and Hooper. Reynolds seems to have the attention span of a hamster. Most of the routine is about how neither he nor the Academy know why he’s there.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zjuyk005y3b61ji6bbehz@published data-word-count=12><strong>Typical line:</strong> [Blows raspberry.] “If you want sophistication, talk to David Niven.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zjuyl005z3b61kyjlzmb4@published data-word-count=15><strong>Low point:</strong> “I love the title The Sting.

He begins on the red carpet, but not saying much that is funny. Things improve only marginally once the show starts. It is the year of The Last Emperor — the ravishing Bertolucci epic that won all nine awards it was nominated for — Fatal Attraction, and Wall Street. There is a taped intro, with quick comic stylized skits showing all the different trades that go into making a film. The music starts sounding familiar and then you notice it is “I Hope I Get It” from A Chorus Line, which has recently been made into a movie, and there is a big rousing dance number.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zkru100743b615iovjcyh@published data-word-count=26>“Good evening, Hollywood phonies,” Chase says. There was a strike, so many of the jokes are about that: “My entire monologue was donated by five teamsters.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zkru100753b61eco3rupe@published data-word-count=76>Otherwise, the onetime SNL star is at his most sour: “Critics are a strange species. Imagine a parent saying, ‘When you grow up I want you to spend all your time going to the movies, and then I want you to make a living talking about what a terrible experience it’s been.’” As someone who saw many of Chase’s movies for professional reasons, I can say there were indeed times when I questioned my career choices.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zkru200763b618usxo0x1@published data-word-count=20><strong>Best joke (I Guess):</strong> “Glenn Close is here with her obstetrician in case anything out of the ordinary pops up.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zkru200773b61v8k2iuq9@published data-word-count=21><strong>Beating-a-Dead-Horse Dept:</strong> “The Academy seriously considered giving out an award for best film critic.

We begin with Army Archerd, the longtime Variety columnist, outside the auditorium’s doors. He’s interviewing a young star with an unpleasant, squeaky voice. It’s Snow White. The idea is that she’s an actress trying to make it in Hollywood. Archerd ushers her in and she goes down the aisle trying to greet various stars, who do their best to ignore her. What comes next was the most outré event in Oscars history, an 11-minute song-and-dance number that can best be described as the trip you’d have after taking a tab of ecstasy and chasing it with a tall glass of denture water from the bedside table of an aging Hollywood icon.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zm4ik008t3b611roabsah@published data-word-count=112>The trouble comes from a number of bad decisions made by producer Allan Carr. The first is lifting ideas and some performers from a campy San Francisco-by-way-of-Vegas theater outfit, Beach Blanket Babylon, known for its breezily low-fi sensibility and enormous architectural headgear, which are amusing in a small venue. But these aspects of the presentation are immediately lost when presented on a worldwide stage. Carr also showcases a bunch of stars from waaay, way back (Dorothy Lamour, Roy Rogers) on a makeshift Coconut Grove nightclub set. These almost to a person come across as not only dragged in but, and I say this with kindness, dragged in from their respective nursing homes.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zm4im008u3b61h3n3fct8@published data-word-count=50>Then Merv Griffin appears to sing “I’ve Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts.” Even those who knew that Griffin got his start at the Grove (an L.A. nightclub) singing that song might have wondered what exactly this had to do with Snow White, not to mention cinema in any sense.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zm4im008v3b61ix0mf2fr@published data-word-count=62>Beyond that, the Snow White conceit, fine in the absurdist confines of BBB, doesn’t really track at an actual movie event. Show White wasn’t an actor, she was a character; there’s a difference. And I haven’t even mentioned the dancing tables, Rob Lowe (then the ingénue star of St. Elmo’s Fire), or the White-Lowe duet to that classic movie tune “Proud Mary.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zm4in008w3b615l72p8ej@published data-word-count=51>It must be said the segment ends with a wowza display of the ultimate Babylon hat, but this landmark, too, is unclear to the audience. Lily Tomlin enters and apparently accidentally loses a shoe as she goes down the stairs, though I can’t tell if that was a shtick or not.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zm4in008x3b619fjfmb06@published data-word-count=13>But there is another amazing thing about this opening. It actually gets worse.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zm4in008y3b61plomj4ez@published data-word-count=79>Richard Kahn, a marketing exec who was then the president of the Academy, appears next, to mouth a succession of phonetic sounds we had heard at this point some 60 times before: “Honoring the outstanding achievements in motion picture for the year …” blah blah blah. He tells us that the show will be seen in 91 countries and, for the first time, in the USSR, many of whose viewers must have been staring at the screen in shock.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zm4in008z3b614c7u6i4h@published data-word-count=14>Kahn then introduces some star power. Hold onto your hats, it’s … Tom Selleck!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zm4in00903b613cxs4pt9@published data-word-count=136>As it happened, Selleck was at the time something passingly like a hot commodity, coming off the hit Three Men and a Baby — the Snakes on a Plane of its day — with fellow thespians Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg. He appeared sporting an odd buzz haircut and a mustache the size of the Hollywood sign, and, if you can believe it, he was there to explain that he was actually not the host. He goes on and on explaining how people will come on, solo or in pairs, to give out awards. Thanks Tom, we didn’t know how these new-fangled Oscars shows work! And throughout — I’m not making this up — there is music playing in back of him that sounds like the exit music played to get long-winded awardees off the stage.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zm4io00913b61qky3hii0@published data-word-count=54>This became the Oscars-show opening that never went away. Repercussions reverberated for months; the Disney company launched a legal attack on the show. The position of the Academy’s lawyers was that Snow White was a figure in the public domain. (Yeah, but the whole point was that she was Snow White from the movie.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zm4io00923b619gogquul@published data-word-count=114>Right about then, the Academy solons were probably wishing for something, anything, to distract attention from the Disney imbroglio. Their prayers were answered, after a fashion, a few months later when Rob Lowe’s sex tape hit the news. At this point the Academy was looking into the void, PR-wise, but for Lowe it was more of a good news/bad news situation: Sure, a tape got released of him having sex, and his movie career was derailed. On the other hand, he’d had the good fortune to make the tape in the enlightened state of Georgia, where it actually wasn’t against the law for movie stars passing through town to film themselves fucking local 16-year-olds.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cje5zmaj8009r3b61zj43qo49@published>61. 1958 (the 30th Oscars)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5znbhp00aj3b61d2g0twtj@published data-word-count=131>Wagon Train, Father Knows Best, and Kraft Theater will not be seen at their usual times tonight …<br><br>George Stevens (director of Swing Time, Shane, and Giant, and three-time Best Director recipient) was the president of the Academy. He told everyone there would be no commercial interruptions in the show — now that’s something they should bring back — and that, “to accommodate the reporters, photographers and newsreel men,” there was now a pavilion next to the stage to interview the winners after each award presentation. He introduced Jimmy Stewart, “one of the few stars who can fill a CinemaScope screen lying down” — which makes no sense if you think about it. There were half a dozen or more semiofficial hosts over the course of the evening, but no monologue.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cje5zoap700bd3b61pcavvqw0@published>60. 1963 (the 35th Oscars)<br>Host: Frank Sinatra</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zotbk00c93b61xib9a03z@published data-word-count=121>It is the notable year of Lawrence of Arabia, which gives David Lean his second Best Picture win; To Kill a Mockingbird; and The Manchurian Candidate. The orchestra kicks off with “Tonight,” from West Side Story, the previous year’s big winner. They wrap it up and we see that … Ol’ Blue Eyes is the host! What follows is one of the weirdest Oscars openings ever. Minutes go by as Sinatra riffs on the Mona Lisa (“The chick just sits there and smiles!”), da Vinci, and the personal vision that comes through in the best art. If da Vinci came to Hollywood, you see, a producer would demand things like, “a cocktail-party scene in the foreground! Give it some production values!”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zp88r00cq3b61h3h4hxxl@published data-word-count=80>We can all agree with him, of course. But it is also heavy-handed, long-winded, more than a bit self-satisfied, and boring. (Sinatra was sort of the Kanye West of his day.) No jokes until the adorable Shelley Winters comes on to give out the first award. “De gustibus,” she says. “That means ‘thank you,’ I think, in Latin.” (It’s possible Winters is improvising and twitting Sinatra’s blathering.) “I’ll check with my druggist,” Frank says and exits, pursued by a bear.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cje5zpdr500dn3b617xk445th@published>59. 2012 (the 84th Oscars)<br>Host: Billy Crystal</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zpi0500eo3b61b6s3sjzc@published data-word-count=125>It is the year of The Artist, with Hugo, The Tree of Life, and Moneyball missing out. The Academy is making something clear. The King’s Speech, the previous year’s winner, made $140 million at the box office, not that much dough in the 2010s. The Artist, a black-and-white affair that would have been in French if there were any dialogue at all, is at $32 million the week of the awards, and will become be the second-lowest-grossing Best Picture winner of the modern era, coming in right after The Hurt Locker, from two years previous, and beating out Crash, from six years earlier. In the years since 2011, the grosses have gone even lower, and it is now only the fifth lowest-grossing Best Picture winner.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje5zuv5r00f83b61jxibxf3p@published data-word-count=74>Anyway, it is Billy Crystal’s ninth stint, back after a ten-year absence. The interim shows, with Chris Rock, Jon Stewart, etc., make his stuff seem even hokier. “Just call me ‘War Horse,’” he says, referring to the year’s Spielberg film. You can hear a pin drop.

Billy Crystal was getting ready to make City Slickers.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje60pm9803uv3b61z1tw69fv@published data-word-count=49>There’s more: He mentions Marlon Brando’s Godfather Best Actor win. “That was 18 moons ago.” (For the record, moons represent months, not years; the joke is that Sacheen Littlefeather, the Native American Brando sent up to accept his award, had won a “Miss American Vampire” pageant two years previous.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje60pm9803uw3b61iuw2z2g6@published data-word-count=129>Crystal’s weirdest joke comes after he introduces Spike Lee and notes that Lee’s acclaimed Do the Right Thing got a Best Screenplay nomination. As the applause dies down Crystal says, “… based on an idea of Art Buchwald’s.” This is a reference to a lawsuit, famous at the time, from columnist Buchwald, who’d pitched an idea to Eddie Murphy and Paramount. They passed — and two years later made Coming to America, which was apparently the same story Buchwald had pitched them. Indeed, Buchwald won; the suit was famous in Hollywood circles regarding a tangential issue, namely laying bare the industry accounting practices that kept even wildly successful films from ever making a profit on paper. The court called this “unconscionable,” but Paramount settled before things went too far.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje60pm9903ux3b61evlrt0h8@published data-word-count=90>Anyway, I go into such detail because it’s hard to parse the joke. Crystal could be making fun of Buchwald, the implication being that he was suing any black movie he could. But Buchwald had won the suit. So it comes across more that “here’s another movie made by a black guy who’d stolen a script.” That’s way off too, because he’s comparing a star like Murphy with a serious artist, Spike Lee. It really just feels like his brain is stuck on “a black guy who made a movie.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje60pm9903uy3b61zw2fp6kp@published data-word-count=57>Then it gets weirder. Crystal says, “… or Andy Rooney.” Rooney was an elderly columnist, too, latterly in the news for saying the sorts of things a decaying old coot would say. But then that makes it seem that Buchwald was being racist, when in fact a court determined that Paramount and Eddie Murphy stole his idea.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje60pm9a03uz3b619celjuyi@published data-word-count=18><strong>Best Joke:</strong> [Entering to applause.] “Is it just me or are you just glad I’m not Snow White?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje60pm9a03v03b61scyd5j3q@published data-word-count=14><strong>Best Industry Joke:</strong> “Jack Nicholson is so rich Morgan Freeman drove him here tonight.”</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cje60q2q1041r3b612vbz4c21@published>37. 2002 (the 74th Oscars)<br>Host: Whoopi Goldberg</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje60qdbb04583b61rfuchno5@published data-word-count=21>“This show is going to be long,” Whoopi Goldberg says. “But not as long as it took to explain Mulholland Drive.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje60r3xn04703b611kl9gc13@published data-word-count=49>Brian Grazer and Ron Howard always felt they’d been screwed out of an Oscar when Apollo 13 lost to Mel Gibson’s Braveheart.

The Academy’s Governors Ball was cancelled, and Hope’s monologue was carefully vetted. Peck notes that two of the Best Picture nominees deal with race; he’s referring to In the Heat of the Night, the eventual winner, and Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner?; but then he goes right into talking about new developments in technology and then an introduction of the host, “that amiable national treasure who pricks pomposity …”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje61kuas08683b615xf03tln@published data-word-count=82>“I will not seek, nor will I accept, an Oscar,” Hope says.

Hope’s joke are funny, but they don’t come close to capturing the drama of the time. “The films this year are so sexy Price Waterhouse is handing out the names in a plain brown envelope.” The Graduate, he says, is “the story of a college student who didn’t go out for sports until he graduated.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje61kuat086a3b616t9rw3oc@published data-word-count=16><strong>Darkest Oscar joke:</strong> “Many an ugly face turns beautiful and many a beautiful face turns ugly.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje61kuat086b3b61yh3ows0m@published data-word-count=16><strong>From the Recycle Bin:</strong> “Mink, ermine, and diamonds.

At Best Picture time, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway were the presenters. Beatty opened the envelope, but then spent a few seconds looking around quizzically before passing it off to Dunaway, who glanced at the card and said “La La Land.” After two minutes of confusion, it turned out they had been given the wrong envelope and the real winner was Moonlight. To everyone’s credit, the Academy and all present handled correcting the mistake professionally. I go into such detail to mention something that didn’t get said enough, which is that the whole thing was Warren Beatty’s fault. He had the envelope and saw something was wrong. He was about to turn 80, but still: He’s a 50-something-year vet of the awards and is supposed to be one of the smartest people in Hollywood. He should have made sure everything was okay before just passing the envelope on to Dunaway.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje63hpan0cqn3b61nwbuzak2@published data-word-count=58>Anyway, Kimmel does well just playing himself, knocking a few soft ones out of the park and occasionally showing contempt where contempt is deserved.

The other big movies are The Shawshank Redemption, Four Weddings and a Funeral, and Kieslowski’s Red.

We see a succession of previous hosts turn the role down for this year, among them Billy Crystal, who is in a Brokeback Mountain–style tent with Chris Rock. We finally come to … Jon Stewart, in bed first with Halle Berry and then George Clooney. Stewart’s monologue is brisk and nails Hollywood, and himself, again and again. “Tonight we celebrate film … with me, the fourth male lead in Death to Smoochy.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje651d3n031f3b61mh24sv7w@published data-word-count=88>Lots of good lines. “There are women here tonight [fake sob] … who can barely afford enough gown to cover their breasts.” He notes that Clooney was nominated several times for Good Night and Good Luck, “which is not just Edward R. Murrow’s sign-off, it’s also how Mr. Clooney ends all of his dates.” And Stewart even tweaks Saint Steven Spielberg, noting Schindler’s List and the nominated Munich. “I’m sure I speak for all Jews when I say, I can’t wait to see what happens to us next!”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje651d3n031g3b619318ie6j@published data-word-count=61>Stewart also gets serious: “I’ve been out here a week and a half and had a great time. A lot of people say this town is too liberal, out of touch with modern-day America, an atheistic pleasure dome, a modern-day beachfront Sodom and Gomorrah, a moral black hole where innocence is obliterated in an endless orgy of sex, gratification, and greed.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje651d3n031h3b616do0a93k@published data-word-count=8>The house is quiet, awaiting the punch line.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje651d3o031i3b61rvqm13jv@published data-word-count=22>“I don’t really have a joke here,” Stewart says. “I just thought you should know a lot of people are saying that.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje651d3o031j3b614aoltfdz@published data-word-count=13><strong>Changing times: “</strong>Ladies, Gentlemen … Felicity.” (Huffman played a transgendered woman in Transamerica.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje651d3o031k3b613foy2pn2@published data-word-count=12><strong>Also: “</strong>Capote shows America that not all gay people are virile cowboys.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje651d3o031l3b619q9tc3tu@published data-word-count=19><strong>Biggest laugh:</strong> “Bjork couldn’t be here tonight.

We also see Amy Irving, who was nominated for Yentl, on the arm of soon-to-be husband Steven Spielberg. According to La Streisand, Spielberg said Yentl was “the best film I’ve seen since Citizen Kane,” a double bank shot of preposterous bullshit. Our Karma Desk reports that the Irving divorce supposedly cost Spielberg $100 million, after a prenup written on a napkin wasn’t accepted by the court. But I digress. It’s the year of Flashdance, WarGames, The Return of the Jedi, The Big Chill, and the big winner this year, Terms of Endearment.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje653ytd03fy3b61gtdev22e@published data-word-count=79>Quincy Jones is conducting and Carson, thankfully, is back after the unfortunate unproduced production number the year before with Liza Minnelli, Dudley Moore, Walter Matthau, and Richard Pryor. Academy president Gene Allen asserts that he’s “just been told” that 500 million people would be watching, and continues with one of the all-time most boring Academy president speeches. Allen’s delivery is basically that of a stoned guy standing in a Taco Bell drive-through lane trying to decide what to order.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje653yte03fz3b61d42vngjj@published data-word-count=48>Finally Carson comes on, hunting for bear. “You don’t realize what a thrill it is for me to appear someplace without being subpoenaed.” Carson went through a number of marriages and divorces during his extended celebrity, and a running joke was how much his divorces had cost him.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje653yte03g03b618bhiwkfg@published data-word-count=54>It’s all worth it for this joke: His latest marriage, he reflects, was a lot like the current year in movies. “It started off with Terms of Endearment.

These attacks are somewhat misdirected: Hollywood hiring practices are the issue, not the Oscars, which since the turn of the century have been increasingly representative.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje65ia2f03un3b618apzptkj@published data-word-count=67>Rock played into this a bit — “Welcome to the White People’s Choice Awards,” he says. “If they nominated hosts, I wouldn’t even get this job.” (Actually, the Oscars had been hosted by an African-American 25 percent of the time in the previous two decades.) Some people, he notes, had said, “‘Chris, you should quit!’ How come it’s only unemployed people who tell you to quit something?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje65ia2g03uo3b61fl1p6rz9@published data-word-count=68>But as you’d expect, he quickly zeroes in on the real issue, which is how Hollywood as an industry related to black people. Rock fires on everyone. He noted that the concern about black nominees was of recent vintage. In the 1960s, things were different. “We had real things to protest at the time.

They might have been intimidated the first time, but can learn from their mistakes and raise the bar the second. Case in point: Neil Patrick Harris, who tonight proffers his second dance number and takes on full hosting duties for the first time. He is basically perfect.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje7ij7sr00ay3b614mjebxf8@published data-word-count=55>Unlike Crystal and Goldberg and Martin, he doesn’t feel he has to remind us how many times he’s been there before. So confident is he that he delivers exactly one lancing joke before launching into a big song: “Welcome to the 86th Oscars,” he says, beaming. “Tonight, we honor Hollywood’s best and whitest. Sorry, brightest.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje7ij7sr00az3b61ti36uc87@published data-word-count=102>Then comes the song, and it’s everything an Oscar opening number should be but never has been before. Producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, who started off producing the Seth McFarlane Oscars but soon righted the ship, hired the pair that brought us Frozen’s “Let It Go,” Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. They crafted a light parody of Broadway excess a la Spamalot—but that turns out to be cover for a highly melodic, genuinely dramatic, hemi-demi-semi-serious tribute to the movies that nails every emotional beat and every absurdist deflation. (The set, with all the hanging Oscars, provides an elegant macabre touch, too.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje7ij7ss00b03b61f7dzyae5@published data-word-count=21>Two guest stars along the way take the number into unexpected directions and put the magic of movies into contemporary context.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje7ij7ss00b13b61oeioki4q@published data-word-count=6>Hard not to like passages like:</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje7ij7ss00b23b613ewny03x@published data-word-count=13>And Bardot and Brando<br>As Billy Dee as Lando<br>And when Sharon went commando</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje7ij7ss00b33b61tce17107@published data-word-count=1>Or</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje7ij7ss00b43b61qb3u4fd8@published data-word-count=14>This industry’s in flux.<br>Run by mucky-mucks<br>Pitching tents for tentpoles<br>And chasing Chinese bucks</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje7ij7ss00b53b614l8geemi@published data-word-count=18>… all set against an evocative, understated film collage and, for the finale, a highly amusing dance corps.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cje7ij7st00b63b6106d4x17k@published data-word-count=43>The only version on You Tube is distorted, but still packs a punch.
