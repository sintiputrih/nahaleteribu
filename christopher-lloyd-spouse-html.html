Sincerely, Your constant admirer.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>The Beautiful Chemistry</h2><p>The first of the two snaps featured the beautiful couple dressed in formals, presumably from an event in the past. The gorgeous wife donned a deep v-neck black dress while the dashing veteran accompanied her with a striped gray shirt paired with a formal black jacket. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The second snap, however, was where the couple was more at-ease. The actor, famous for portraying Dr. Brown, was embracing his beloved as she clung to him in excitement. The moment was tied together perfectly&nbsp;with the light of the setting sun illuminating the backdrop.&nbsp;</p><h2>Fans React</h2><p>The post immediately gathered attention from the fans, and they were quick to drop their words in the comment section.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>One fan appreciated the couple and commented, “Oh wow the love keeps on going.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“Doc, you're a truly gentleman. Happy Valentine's day to this beautiful couple,” chimed another.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>A few were also judgy about the couple’s relationship, especially about their age difference. One follower even encouraged others to join in on the discussion when they&nbsp;questioned: “Does anyone else find it weird that his valentine is like half his age?"&nbsp;The couple does not seem to give much weight to the negative comments.</p><h2>Together For Four Years And Counting</h2><p>The couple has been relishing their married life since they&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tied</a> the knot on November 23, 2016. Their adorable pictures often pop up on the actor’s Instagram handle. That being said, Lisa maintains a private life, keeping her personal details under wraps. Her Instagram handle is also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">private</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Despite the natural chemistry between the two, the actor’s marriage with Lisa is not his first—she is Christopher’s fifth wife.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>His Past Relationships</h2><p>The 82-year-old actor first got <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a> to Catherine Boyd on June 6, 1959. But their marriage ended in divorce after 12 years in 1971.</p><p>After that, he was married to actress Kay Tornborg from 1974 to 1987. The following year, Christopher married for the third time to Carol Ann Vanek. But that marriage also ended very soon; they separated in 1991. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>He walked the aisle for the fourth time with journalist Jane Walker Wood on February 21, 1992. But things did not work out between the two,&nbsp;and they separated on December 28, 2008.</p><p>Apparently, for&nbsp;Christopher, the fifth time's the charm!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnk52%2Fqr%2FTqKehnaJiua272J1krKifqsCmesetpKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
