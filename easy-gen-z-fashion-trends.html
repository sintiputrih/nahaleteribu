Initially, we cringe and reject certain styles, but after seeing them over and over again—often on our favorite celebrities—they begin to grow on us. Pretty soon, they've invaded our wardrobe, and then we find that we can't even imagine living without them. That's sort of how I feel about the '90s and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>'00s resurgence</a>, which is seemingly being led by Gen Z, who didn't experience these questionable looks the first time around.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At first, I, a millennial, disapproved; were we really about to bring back bulky socks, boot-cut jeans, and tiny monogrammed shoulder bags? It felt like a flashback directly to my awkward stage. But, the more I saw modern outfit ideas and new ways to style trends I once considered "bad" (like, bad), I became curious. Now, there's also a long list of Gen Z-approved trends that I've now fully embraced, all of which are a bit more classic than extreme and are nostalgic in a less obvious way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep scrolling for Gen Z socks and other fashion trends worth investing in.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-graphic-sweatshirts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Graphic Sweatshirts</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First came the return of graphic tees and now, their sweatshirt counterparts. All those random vacation souvenirs and college pullovers are now considered cool, and they can be worn with everything from skirts to leggings to structured trousers. I'm fully on board and also love the preppy <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>turtleneck layering</a> trick for cooler days.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pleated-skirts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pleated Skirts</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kirstin Sinclair/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Schoolcore</a> has surprisingly taken off as a top trend, and the key to nailing the look is a plaid, pleated, uniform-like skirt. While this piece no doubt works for dressed-up and professional occasions, the modern way to wear it is casually, styled with a sweatshirt or tee and your favorite sneakers or loafers.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-long-socks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Long Socks</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I remember when showing your sock was a huge faux pas, but these days it's all about bulky, chunky, and eye-catching ankle warmers—and it's a smart move. Now, shorts, skirts, and even sweatpants have added interest at the ankle, and if you opt for a pair that isn't white, it's a quick way to work color into an outfit.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-non-skinny-jeans></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Non-Skinny Jeans</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You don't have to give up on skinnies completely, but there's no harm in adding other cuts to your collection, such as mom- or boot-cut jeans. They're slightly looser (which is way comfier, in my opinion) but still just as versatile, and if you're struggling to find footwear, a pair of classic Converse will work every time.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-strappy-cutout-pants></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Strappy, Cutout Pants</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Streetstyleshooters/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While I'm not quite ready for the return of low-rise, I find myself drawn to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>thong pants</a>. They're kind of like the best of both worlds: While many options are high enough to hold me in, the cutout lends a sexy, skin-baring twist. Plus, this detail is included on so many stretchy, yoga-like bottoms, taking the comfy staple well beyond loungewear.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-baguette-bags></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Baguette Bags</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you were a teen or pre-teen in the early '00s, you probably owned a similar bag, possibly made by Coach. Well, it's time to go digging through storage, because following the popularity of the micro-mini purse, baguettes have fully returned. Thankfully, there's enough room to just hold all the essentials, so it's a wise choice if you tend to overpack (guilty).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-novelty-prints></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Novelty Prints</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you love puff sleeves and polka-dots, this trend will fit right in with your whimsical wardrobe. Novelty prints are like graphic sweaters but often depict a handful of quirky images or even a full scene.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-platform-shoes></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Platform Shoes</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lug sole boots</a>, chunky sandals, flatforms—as a petite person, I'm all for added height without the pain of a classic pump, and I'm especially fond of platform sneakers. You can throw them on as easily as your typical kicks, but the thick, eye-catching bottoms add something special to your outfit, and '90s kids finally get to live out their Spice Girls fashion dream.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ykuM6tn6Kml2Syor%2FYZp6epl2veqet0qGgqKZdqb%2BmusOs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
