Top competitors from the previous 11 seasons have returned to exhibit what they‚Äôve learned after leaving the competition. They are competing for a chance to prove that they have what it takes to win the championship. Two Junior Edition chefs have also returned to compete as adults.&nbsp;MasterChef: Return to Victory The main goal for the candidates is to wow judges Gordon Ramsay, Aaron Sanchez, and Joe Bastianich with their excellent culinary abilities. A total of forty chefs were summoned to the kitchen for an audition. Only 20 people received the infamous white apron.</p><p>During the auditions, the returning chefs had to compete in groups of four. Two of the four chefs who created the greatest comeback dish and pleased the judges got an apron and a berth in the Top 20 at the conclusion of each round.&nbsp;Gabriel, Shelly, Fred, Bri, Samantha, and Alejandro were awarded the remaining six seats. Fred and Bri‚Äôs dish was also well received by viewers. The couple made an appearance in Season 10. Bri is recognized for her superb plating talents, but Fred is known for his chocolate cake that had Gordon Ramsay licking the platter.</p><p>For the judges, Fred made a vegan and gluten-free dinner. With Kumquat Puree, Black Cacao Ash, and Kinako Crumble, he created a Dark Chocolate & Tofu Mousse.&nbsp;Bri‚Äôs Pan Seared Seabass with Fennell Puree, Tomato Medley, Pickled Serrano Peppers, and Tomato Water were presented to the judges. Both contenders amazed the judges with their meals and took home the night‚Äôs first two aprons. MasterChef Season 12 airs on Fox every Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET.
