He has a 161-39 record.</li></ul><p>The Athletic‚Äôs instant analysis:</p><h2>A season for the ages in Knoxville</h2><p>The Vols have their first 11-win season in 21 years, since a 2001 Phillip Fulmer-coached team that had the goods to win it all finished 11-2. They should be looking at their first top-5 finish since that same season. And they finally had a good experience in the Orange Bowl, 25 years after Peyton Manning‚Äôs final collegiate game was a blowout loss to Nebraska (this is UT‚Äôs first Orange Bowl win since Jan. 2, 1939, over <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Oklahoma</a>, by the way).</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Mostly, this was a satisfying finish to a dream season for a program that is well beyond what anyone could have expected when second-year coach Josh Heupel took over a bad situation. UT just beat top-shelf programs <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Alabama</a> and Clemson in the same season and has relevance it hasn‚Äôt enjoyed since Fulmer had it rolling in Knoxville. ‚Äî&nbsp;Rexrode</p><h2>How did Milton look?</h2><p>The Orange Bowl was largely about getting a look at backup quarterback Milton ‚Äî in for <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Hendon Hooker</a>, who suffered an ACL tear in the Vols‚Äô Nov. 19 loss at <a class=ath_autolink href=#>South Carolina</a> ‚Äî as he tries to make his case to start for the Vols next season. Friday‚Äôs performance was a mixed bag, much more good than bad, though Milton isn‚Äôt yet Hooker when he runs this offense (and of course, it should be noted that UT‚Äôs top two receivers, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jalin Hyatt</a> and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Cedric Tillman</a>, have declared for the draft and didn‚Äôt play).</p><p>Milton threw lasers for touchdowns of 16 and 14 yards to <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Bru McCoy</a> and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Squirrel White</a>, respectively, and connected with White for a 50-yard gain to set up another score. He opened the game up with a 46-yard deep touchdown to <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ramel Keyton</a>. He also took some sacks you don‚Äôt want to take and didn‚Äôt always look comfortable. He finished 19-of-28 passing for over 250 yards and did nothing to change his status as the clear favorite to start next season as UT‚Äôs QB1. ‚Äî&nbsp;Rexrode</p><h2>Plenty of Clemson miscues</h2><p>Clemson will spend its offseason counting the miscues that cost the Tigers the Orange Bowl. They‚Äôll have plenty of time and might need it. Senior kicker Potter entered Friday‚Äôs game 18-of-21 on field goals but missed his first three attempts and the Tigers failed to convert a fake field goal in the first half, too.</p><p>Klubnik also let time get away from him on a pair of quarterback runs that turned a red-zone trip at the end of the first half into a fruitless trip.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Clemson spent most of the first half on Tennessee‚Äôs side of the field and only had three points to show for it. In a game slightly lower scoring than expected, that spelled doom for the Tigers‚Äô chances to close the season with a victory. ‚Äî&nbsp;Ubben</p><h2>How did Cade Klubnik look?</h2><p>Freshman five-star Klubnik‚Äôs bowl debut had mixed results. He took a parade of hits from Tennessee‚Äôs aggressive, blitzing defensive scheme and the Tigers‚Äô offensive line struggled to keep his pocket clean. But in his first career start, Klubnik made plays with his feet and delivered the ball when he had time. However, he looked a bit skittish with oncoming rushers in his face.</p><p>His numbers for the day (30-of-54 passing, 320 yards) were decent but it wasn‚Äôt the coming out party against Tennessee‚Äôs vulnerable secondary that might have ignited an offseason of hype. He showed flashes and promise but also plenty of reminders he‚Äôs a work in progress. ‚Äî Ubben</p><h2>Highlight of the game</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>JOE.
