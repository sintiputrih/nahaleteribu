He said he had no qualms about having designs on other body parts, but having them on the face was something he discouraged. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The 'Me Too' singer elaborated on the reason, citing that so much came with having ink on the face. He highlighted the designs would change one's look and make them look like a killer.&nbsp;</p><p>He noted tattoos were socially acceptable and said it was his sole opinion on why people shouldn't get face tattoos.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Sticking by his belief,&nbsp;Gates shared he wouldn't want his daughter Islah Koren Gates to have body arts in the future. He humorously added that he and his wife, <a href=# rel=follow>Dreka Gates</a>, had marked enough designs so that she wouldn't have to. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The 35-year-old even showcased his fatherly love, saying she didn't have to do anything as she was already beautiful.&nbsp;Gates and Dreka welcomed their daughter on November 30, 2012, years before tying the knot&nbsp;in October 2015.</p><h2>Gates' Face Tattoos Come From Pain</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Gates has five visible tattoos on his face, including&nbsp;three monochrome teardrops and a star under his eyes. In addition, he has a remarkable design for a soldier's sign on his forehead, right between his eyebrows.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"Everything has a significant meaning," the musical artist shared during an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with VladTV</a> in August 2014. He even added that his face tattoos came from a place of pain. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Gates clarified that the ink on his forehead didn't incline to religion, which people usually mistake for a typical&nbsp;Christian cross. Instead, he remarked it was a soldier's sign — a compass showing south, north, east, and west.&nbsp;</p><p>The father-of-two also set the records straight for his teardrop designs. He mentioned how most people thought his tattoos were a mark of him being a killer. Dispelling all theories, he clarified the teardrops meant "forever in sorrow." He also shared that the star under his right eye was a symbol of the god.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides the five mentioned arts, Gates also has 'NUK' marked on his left ear. He had the name tattoo for his cousin,&nbsp;Nuk The Rapper.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Moreover, the rapper has many body arts, including a tree, eagle, elephant, house, and multiple names, numbers, and letters.&nbsp;On top of that, he has numerous portraits featuring&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>YoungBoy Never Broke Again</a>, Bob Marley,&nbsp;Luca Brasi from The Godfather,&nbsp;OG Boobie Black, and <a href=# rel=follow>Elvis Presley</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKOVq7avecaaq56rXZuupLGMrZitrJ%2BkwG%2B006aj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
