Beef explained!</h2><p>Following her drama on the infamous reality TV show, Sammi decided to take a step back from the spotlight and live a "normal life." While her former roommates continued their reality careers, Sammi tells Angelina that she didn't want to sign up for the show when it was rebooted. Instead, Sammi pursued her passion for clothes and opened up a beach boutique in Ocean City, N.J., called "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweetheart Coast</a>."</p><p>"I opened a beach boutique, something different than what anybody else had done and it's right on the boardwalk," Sam tells Angelina. "Nicole shortly after that decided to open up a beach boutique.
