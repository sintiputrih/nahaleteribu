How are her kids and husband handling the news?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Jen Shah and her husband of 27 years, Sharrieff Shah Sr., share two kids.</h2><p>Jen and her husband, <a href=#>Sharrieff Shah Sr.</a>, have two sons, Sharrieff Jr. and Omar. The kids made their debut in the Season 1 premiere of RHOSLC. They went on to star in a handful of <a href=#>RHOSLC</a> episodes — including the one capturing Jen's arrest.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Sharrieff Jr. studied at the Utah State University before pursuing a bachelor of science degree in kinesiology and exercise science at the University of Utah. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>, he also took courses in pre-medical studies while at the school.</p><p>He worked as an undergraduate research assistant between December 2017 and June 2019. What's more, he used to be a student-athlete and a youth football coach at his alma mater.</p><p>Sharrieff Jr. sort of followed in his dad's footsteps. A talented athlete, Sharrieff Sr. played for the Utes between 1990 and 1993. He also ran indoor track, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Women's Health</a>. He built a lucrative career as a lawyer, certified sports agent, and football analyst.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@therealjenshah</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Jen Shah's younger son, Omar, is a teenager.</h2><p>Jen's second son, Omar, is a high school football player. As her Instagram posts suggest, Jen is close to and supportive of her sons, and the whole family has remained tight-knit through Jen's legal troubles.</p><p>While discussing her sentencing in the Season 3 premiere of RHOSLC, Jen said, "I'm not thinking about myself, I'm thinking about my family. I can't imagine being away from them. It would literally kill me."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@therealjenshah</a></figure><p>Both of Jen's sons and her husband Sharieff reportedly wrote letters to the judge presiding over her case in support of a lenient sentence for her. Court documents obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RadarOnline</a> in December 2022 reveal that Jen's oldest, Sharieff Jr., wrote to the court, "I recognize that regardless of her recent mistakes, my mother has exemplified positive ideals throughout my entire life.</p><p>"I am happy to have learned from her and to have gained an understanding that all individuals are flawed, and these flaws do not negate their positive aspects. From my earliest memories, I can recall my mother modeling the ideals of generosity and caring."</p><p>"While I understand that there must be a consequence for these actions," his letter continued, "I am asking that you view my mother through a lens of forgiveness and compassion. I believe that my mother recognizes her wrongdoings and will be a better service to society if given a sentence of probation."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">When does Jen Shah have to report to prison?</h2><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News,</a> Jen has six weeks of freedom.
