My kids went back to school today which always brings some mixed emotions. I have been craving structure and a clean home but will miss our lazy days just playing.

We stayed on the beach and had time to decompress and relax with the family, which was so nice after the busy nature of Christmas."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I have been craving structure and a clean home but will miss our lazy days just playing. We made a spontaneous trip to San Diego for New Year’s with my Mom and Dad and my brother’s family. We stayed on the beach and had time to decompress and relax with the family, which was so nice after the busy nature of Christmas.</p><p>But I had to leave the churros and tacos behind and now it’s all about healthy eating! I am actually super excited to get back to an exercise routine and healthy dinners with the fam. I found that making healthy choices is so much about preparation. If I stock the refrigerator with fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and nutritious soups then I reach for them rather than my KitchenAid in order to make cookies!</p><h4><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DSC_0095-copy2.jpg alt="Healthy Tropical Chicken Salad made with lean chicken breast, greek yogurt, fresh pineapple, almonds, green onions, and spices.

It’s high in protein since greek yogurt has 23 grams of protein per cup! The addition of fresh pineapple, almonds, green onions, and spices give it an undeniable freshness. You can even add coconut, oranges, and celery if you would like!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DSC_0098-copy.jpg alt="Healthy Tropical Chicken Salad made with lean chicken breast, greek yogurt, fresh pineapple, almonds, green onions, and spices.

We tried many variations in our home and my family preferred the simple spices rather than the exotic. Curry didn’t make the cut in this chicken salad but your family may love it.</p><p>This Healthy Tropical Chicken Salad made with Greek Yogurt can be made ahead of time and be snacked on all week long. My daughter goes crazy over chicken salad and since she leaves for school at 6:00 am, this is an ideal easy lunch. This can be eaten alone, on a bed of lettuce, or placed between two pieces of whole grain bread.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DSC_0047-copycrop.jpg alt="Healthy Tropical Chicken Salad made with lean chicken breast, greek yogurt, fresh pineapple, almonds, green onions, and spices.
