In the Metal Hammer interview,&nbsp;the musician recounted the awful situation surrounding the first time Ghost received notable attention. In 2010, several of the songs that would later be released on Ghost's first album&nbsp;"Opus Eponymous" made waves online, and Forge had decided to fully commit himself to the project. The Ghost train was about to leave the station, but a truly shocking tragedy coincided with the first time the world was subjected to the band's music:&nbsp;The completely unexpected death of Forge's older brother on&nbsp;March 12, 2010.&nbsp;</p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 [" bulletlist>Forge's brother perished after midnight without warning, due to a heart ailment no one knew about. He was 13 years older than Forge, and the person who introduced the future Ghost superstar to rock music in the first place. The news arrived just after Forge had realized that the Ghost songs he'd uploaded in MySpace were going viral, and he received a record deal shortly after the incident.</p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 [" bulletlist>The cruel irony of the situation wasn't lost on Forge, who remains driven by his loss. "It felt like some weird trade: the band for my brother," the musician said. "It was like, 'This has happened, there's nothing I can do with it, I've just got to take the ball and run with it.' And I've been running with it ever since."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kmlnam9hZMGzrcaimmaclamuqrjSZp6hp6OpwG7Azpugmqtdm7yzs8Ro</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
