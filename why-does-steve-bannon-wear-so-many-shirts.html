It goes without saying that Steve Bannon is one of the most divisive figures in modern politics. As the White House chief strategist during the first seven months of former President Donald Trump's administration, Steve became a well-known figure across the U.S. Now serving as the chairman of Breitbart News, he is under heavy scrutiny for failing to comply with a Jan."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Namely, the fact that he always seems to wear multiple shirts while out and about. So, why does Bannon wear so many shirts? Let's unpack what we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why does Steve Bannon wear so many shirts?</h2><p>Bannon's penchant for wearing multiple collared shirts at once is well-documented, but interestingly enough he has actually never spoken about it directly. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cut</a>, who spoke with Chris Bannon (his younger brother) and close friends of the former White House official, Bannon has enjoyed wearing multiple shirts for some time now.</p><p>Apparently, the style choice is something that he picked up while he was in Benedictine College Preparatory military school in Virginia. Mike Forster, who also attended the school, said, "I don‚Äôt know what the uniform was exactly when Mr. Bannon was here. It ranges from wearing camouflage fatigues and sometimes dress shirts, or pants and tunics. There‚Äôs not multiple shirts."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>For context, Mike and Bannon are roughly the same age. Mike added, "I remember, when I was in college, there were kids who wore multiple shirts. They‚Äôd wear a turtleneck with a shirt and a jacket."</p><p>A quick glance at the promotional video on the school's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official website</a> shows men in what appears to be two shirts in one scene.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Bannon's spokesperson gave further context to The Cut, saying, "Never two. N-e-v-e-r t-w-o," about the number of shirts he wears. "Never one. Certainly n-e-v-e-r o-n-e. And most of the time never two. It‚Äôs usually three, he usually has three shirts on."</p><p>"What do shirts say about Steve Bannon?" the spokesperson continued. "He‚Äôs always got a contingency plan. If one shirt gets ruined, put the next one on. If one pen dies? Just use another pen."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Social media has been reacting to Steve Bannon's choice to wear multiple shirts.</h2><p>Bannon is in the national spotlight right now as he is on trial for ignoring a subpoena regarding the Jan. 6 insurrection. Naturally, social media is having a field day with his choice to wear multiple shirts to the trial.</p><p>"Bannon just came out as jury selection in break. I counted at least three shirts. No tie.
