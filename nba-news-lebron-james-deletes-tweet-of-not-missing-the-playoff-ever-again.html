The Lakers were seven games below .500 and 2.5 games out of the play-in berth prior to their matchup with Orlando on Tuesday. They were also on the decline. It also happens to coincide with Anthony Davis‚Äôs prolonged absence from the Lakers. Without him, the group has often appeared adrift, especially on the court‚Äôs defensive end.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Skip Bayless denies all claims of Lakers wasting LeBron James‚Äô ‚ÄòYears of Greatness‚Äô</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-can-lebron-james-s-lakers-still-make-the-playoffs><strong>Can LeBron James‚Äôs Lakers still make the playoffs?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/LeBron-1024x576.jpeg><p>There was scarcely a worse start for the Lakers this season than the one they had. They were put in a difficult situation right away, and the early stages of the new campaign saw a significant portion of their margin for error disappear.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Anthony Davis‚Äô</a> injury seemed much more devastating than it already had and made the playoffs appear even further away. This season, the Lakers largely depended on both Davis and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LeBron James</a>, so losing one of them makes the fight much more difficult.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The Lakers might still contend for a postseason spot provided they can maintain their composure if AD‚Äôs injury is not serious, and if a trade is done to strengthen the squad or both. But there are a lot of ‚Äúifs‚Äù there. The next month or two might determine a significant portion of the Lakers‚Äô playoff odds.</p><p>The team‚Äôs schedule is substantially lighter than it was earlier in the year, in particular. At this juncture, the Lakers cannot afford to tread water in a playoff race, so if they can put together a run during this time without AD, the postseason may become more plausible.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch: LeBron James gets into a heated altercation with someone on the Magic bench</a></p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Russell Westbrook breaks all boundaries to establish himself as Triple-Double King</a></p><p><strong>Do follow us on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Google News</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57zZuYZqaVrMBuuMSbqaimXZ%2BurrHSZpuepJWpsrR507CcnqxdpLNuus6tZKaho6i2r7OMrZ%2BeZaChrrq7xZ9knq6Vp3qis8CipWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
