In more recent years, Matthew got engaged to his girlfriend <a class=hm-link href=#>Molly Hurwitz</a> in November 2020, a year after they began dating. In 2021, however, the couple parted ways.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/27b896c48142-lizzy-caplan-matthew-perry.jpg><p id=eMKE-5WJmD data-wc=34>Molly reacted to her former fiancé's death, writing in part: "No one in my adult life has influenced me more deeply than Matthew Langford Perry.

Away from the cameras, the actor was previously in a relationship with TV producer Aurora Mulligan, who he met on the set of Top Gear. Aurora is believed to be 17 years younger than Matt and was born in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. In 2022, it was reported that they had split after almost six years of dating.</p><p id=epFW3vAnDDDr data-wc=36>Matt was previously married to American model Melissa McKnight from 2003 until 2006, and they share a 19-year-old daughter together, Marina.

Matt told Ellen: "I was filming in London for Top Gear and James Burrows was in town – the director who directed the first episode of Friends. He had tickets to see [Bruce] Springsteen at Wembley Stadium – who he's friends with, so he invited me to go.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3cda8f7a8039-matt-leblanc-and-aurora.jpg><p id=eZzEwzCknvNL data-wc=60>"Since my daughter and stepdaughter were in town, we all went to the gig. We all went backstage then into the hospitality suite to meet Bruce - and Prince Harry was there. So at the end of the night, Prince Harry gives my daughter and stepdaughter a kiss goodnight on the cheek - and they were both just so floored."</p><h2>David Schwimmer</h2><p id=e8WhBLOLiPLb data-wc=63>He was the soft-centred palaeontologist on Friends&nbsp;who had an on-off relationship with Jennifer's character, Rachel, but in real life, David Schwimmer is thought to be single. David divorced his wife-of-seven-years Zoe Buckman in 2017 and there's been no news of a new partner in his life. <a class=hm-link href=#>The couple share a daughter Cleo</a>, age 12 who looks very much like her famous father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aad6c6afa970-david-schwimmer-zoe-buckman.jpg><p id=ehaSNYFbBXIH data-wc=38>At the time of their separation, David and Zoe released the following statement: "It is with great love, respect and friendship that we have decided to take some time apart while we determine the future of our relationship.</p><p id=e6ezIGBlxMeT data-wc=41>"Our priority is, of course, our daughter's happiness and wellbeing during this challenging time, and so we ask for your support and respect for our privacy as we continue to raise her together and navigate this new chapter for our family."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSorJiav26tzZ1km5mSrnx2fJVsZ29nnZqytXnToZxmnqKesq%2Bw0maamqukqHqnrcyio6Kdo2K6osDToZywZaCav7PFjKOcp6aZm7KzecCnoKysn6N6pLvUq6ueppWueqS712akqKqVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
