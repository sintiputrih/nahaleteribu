The couple had been dating since 2001 and got married in 2013 after being together for 12 years.</p><p>Natalya and TJ Wilson have been in love for a long time and have even worked together onscreen as well. However, Nattie did reveal that she was indeed attracted to former WWE Superstar Fandango.</p><p>This happened <a href=#>during an episode of Total Divas,</a> where Natalya got a little flirty with Fandango meeting him backstage. Natalya complimented him while admiring Fandango’s arms until he jokingly prompted her to stop checking them out. Moreover, she also revealed to Summer Rae that her husband did not mind Natalya checking out the former NXT Tag Team champion.</p><p>“You know what’s funny? That TJ doesn’t even care that I check him out. I think he’s cute too.”</p><p>Natalya is a former 2-time Women’s champion and has been with WWE for nearly 15 years. Her perseverance and love for the business helped Nattie become a mainstay for the company, with no signs of hanging up her boots anytime soon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>Do you think Natalya likes to flirt with other male WWE superstars too?
