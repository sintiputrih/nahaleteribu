Kanye wakes me up & says he’s doing a free concert in Yerevan, Armenia! I throw on <a href=# data-link=1>sweats</a> & we go!” she wrote. “Thousands of people were there! Kanye jumped in swan lake to be closer to the crowd on the other side & so many people jumped in too! Such an exciting crazy night! So happy I got to rock out with everyone in Armenia on our last night here!!!! #EpicNight #ArmenianPride,” she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmZ6usm7DxKyrZqKlor20ecinq6hlnJa4pnnDrqmippdirrO5xKegmmWXnrRuvM6loJydXajBsLzSZpqoppOav7V5kWlobmljaXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
