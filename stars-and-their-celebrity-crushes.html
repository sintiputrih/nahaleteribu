The <a href=#>Game of Thrones</a> alum opened up about the experience in June 2019, saying that after she spotted Perry rehearsing for a play next to her house in 2016, she <a href=#>began frequenting the local grocery store nearby</a> to get a glimpse of him and make her move.</p><p>“I would walk around the corner every day and I would see Matthew Perry smoking a cigarette,” she recalled during a “#BehindTheTweets” interview with Twitter. “And I bought a lighter from Budgens [store] so that I could walk up to him and offer to light his cigarette. [Unfortunately] it was already lit, so, that was just embarrassing.”</p><p>Olympian <a href=#><strong>Simone Biles</strong></a>, on the other hand, fell hard for <a href=#><strong>Zac Efron</strong></a> well before she won a gold medal at the Rio Olympics in 2016.</p><p>Biles gushed to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in August of that year about her crush on the <a href=#>High School Musical</a> star before <a href=#>meeting him in Rio</a> weeks later while doing an interview on the Today show.</p><p>“On cloud 9 @zacefron,” the athlete captioned a GIF of herself kissing the actor on the cheek after their surprise meeting.

He was my first crush,” the Beauty and the Beast star told <a href=#>Seventeen</a> in June 2011. “He totally knows. We talked about it — we still laugh about it.
