At the end of his number, he had a dog bone in his mouth.</p><p>Baffled by his bizarre performance, judge <strong>Len Goodman</strong> sniped, "I don't think the world is ready for your interpretation of the jive …. it probably needed a pooper scooper at the end." <strong>Bruno Tonioli</strong> was harsher, scolding him, "You should take the bone and go back into the dog house.

After his number, cohost <strong>Brooke Burke</strong> told Bolton, "I just want to hug you!"</p><p>The night's most buzzed-about contestants — <strong>The Situation</strong> and <strong>Bristol Palin</strong> — didn't do nearly as bad.</p><p>The Situation (real name: Mike Sorrentino) scored an 18 out of 30 for his quick step. Judge Len told him he did "better than last week," and <strong>Carrie Ann Inaba</strong> thanked him "for not doing the fist pump."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>With mom <strong>Sarah Palin</strong> cheering her on in the audience, Bristol wowed the judges with her quick step, earning 22 out of 30. Judge Carrie Ann told her she reminded her of previous DWTS contestant <strong>Kelly Osbourne</strong>:"There is something so beautiful about watching you," she told her. Bristol said the decent score felt "amazing."</p><p>With Bolton ranking last, <strong>Jennifer Grey</strong> remains the frontrunner, earning the night's top score — 24 out of 30 — for her jive. Judge Bruno told her that her routine was "killer."</p><p>Come back to <a href=#>UsMagazine.com</a> Tuesday morning for more complete coverage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuwrKNiuqqvx5qcpWWSpLm1u81mmaKykae%2FprjYZpqrmaehwG671K1kqJ5dmbyoecKanp5lYmV%2BcX6WcmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
