His life is a shining example of how full one can be when you live with love, compassion, humor, inclusion and community.”</p><p class=p1>Kenneth continued to act after receiving his diagnosis.</p><p class=p1>“Working on<i> Lower Decks </i>is the last time I remember walking before having to be in a motorized wheelchair,” he previously told <a href=# rel=noopener><i>SyFy Wire </i></a>in 2020 of the <i>Star Treks </i>spinoff. “I remember walking up the stairs to go into the studio and the recording booth, and I remember having a great time with [showrunner] <strong>Mike [McMahan]</strong> and the team. And then I remember walking down the stairs but having trouble getting down. But, to be honest, that’s my last memory of walking on my own. And for that to be [my] last memory, it’s pretty damn special.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasrJGnerW%2BxKSqZqOVo7umwMdmpKKsk52yrbiMnZyanF2WwW6AmGaYn6yVp3qiuNJmmZqspKGycA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
