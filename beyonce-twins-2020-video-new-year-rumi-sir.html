The heavily awaited moment, which ended in tons of confetti, was the start of a slide show of photos from more events and milestone moments throughout 2020.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Beyonce-Shares-Rare-Look-Twins-Goodbye-2020-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“Cheers to a New Year Beyhive!!,” Beyonce began in the caption of her post, noting that “2020 divided us and united us. Most could not see loved ones and we felt too many losses, but we were united by our humanity,” she explained. “This year for me has been about celebrating joy, chasing happiness, and living in love.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Beyonce continued, “As we all look forward and pray for new beginnings, my wish for you is that you honor yourself and those you love.&nbsp;Celebrate that you are an important individual who contributes to our beautiful collective,” she wrote, adding, “Here’s to a better and brighter 2021!&nbsp;Love,&nbsp;B.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Beyonce-Shares-Rare-Look-Twins-Goodbye-2020-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>The video also highlights the ongoing <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>COVID-19 pandemic</a>, and shows Beyonce’s “BeyGood” Covid testing site as part of her impact fund to help those affected by the virus. The singer teamed up with Twitter CEO <strong>Jack Dorsey</strong> on a $6 million COVID-19 relief project to support <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mental health</a>. A clip shows Bey’s mom, <strong>Tina Knowles Lawson</strong> on a video call discussing the project. Additional moments featured in the clip include Beyonce expressing her gratitude for healthcare workers, as well as her class of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2020 commencement speech</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Other highlights included Beyonce’s Black Is King&nbsp;visual album, her BET humanitarian award presented by former First Lady <strong>Michelle Obama</strong>, her multiple Vogue covers, her multi-year partnership with Peloton, her endorsing President-elect <strong>Joe Biden</strong> and Vice President-elect<strong> Kamala Harris.&nbsp;</strong>Beyonce even shared a special video message to <strong>Chloe x Halle</strong>, the Grammy-nominated duo she helped discover, congratulating them on their many accomplishments in 2020.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>In-between sultry photos of Bey in a cheetah-print one-piece, a home video played that showed the singer with her twins, who turn 4-years-old on June 13. Other home videos showed Blue singing in the studio with her mom, as well as Beyonce telling a <strong>Snoop Dogg</strong> joke. These intimate moments and glimpses in to her personal life are rare treats from Bey, who’s usually very private about her home life.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The video ends with a final message from Beyonce to her fans: “Give yourself permission to experience joy. Moments with the ones you love are precious. Happy New Year.
