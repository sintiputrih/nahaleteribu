These videos usually start with folks at a dinner table laughing only to be interrupted by someone (the person paying the bill) doing a voiceover as they yell "Broke people should never laugh." The quote is immediately followed by silence from the laughing party.</p><p>The quote <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly</a> comes from rapper-singer <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a>.</p><p>The situation seems to vary between videos, with individual TikTokers calling out different demographics who can't chip in for their food.</p><p>"When you're on holiday in your 20s and 30s and your parents still pick up the cheque," one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> caption states.</p><p>"When your dad still pays for you <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in your 20s...</a>"</p><p>"When you're <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">23 and 24</a> and your older sister still picks up the tab..."</p><p>"When your <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">kids</a> are being bad AF and start ordering refills," and so on.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>For the most part, it's meant to be a lighthearted jab from someone with the financial stability to pay for dinner, though it could easily be misconstrued as someone punching down at people who aren't exactly flush. It makes sense for misbehaving kids, but it can carry different connotations for millennials and Gen Z kids.</p><p>Nevertheless, folks in the comments sections for these videos seem to be taking it in good spirits.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Humble them real quick," one person commented.</p><p>Another user even sympathized with the plight, writing, "I'm 27 with a kid and married and look forward to vacations with my parents because they'll pay for the food every time."</p><p>Another person felt for the person paying the bill, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claiming</a>, "I just know that bill was in the triple digits."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Having money isn't always easy for folks, but people seem to be taking this latest TikTok trend in stride.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2Bwt8Rmp56noKGybr%2FHqKylnF2jsrex0Wajmq2XnXq1tcqtpqRlpKeyr7A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
