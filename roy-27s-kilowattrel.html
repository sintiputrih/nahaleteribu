Roy chased after Wattrel, until it reached a cliff, where it turned around to face Fuecoco. After a brief confrontation, Roy agreed to share the sandwich, only for Wattrel to steal both halves of it. Soon after, Roy noticed that Wattrel wasn't flying away with others of its kind.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=HZ014>Fly! Wattrel!!</a></i>, Roy sought Wattrel out again in order to help it learn to fly. Wattrel's fear of heights made this hard, so Roy eventually got the idea of using <a href=# title=Ludlow>Ludlow</a>'s <a href=# title=Fishing>fishing</a> rod to support Wattrel mid-air while it attempted to fly. This strategy eventually succeeded, allowing Wattrel to fly as high as the others of its kind. Happy to see Wattrel flying, Roy was about to leave, only for Wattrel to fly after him. Taking this as a sign that Wattrel wanted to be <a href=# title="Caught Pokémon">caught</a> by Roy, <a href=# title=Murdock>Murdock</a> gave him a <a href=# title="Poké Ball (item)">Poké Ball</a> to do so. When a sudden gust of wind threw Wattrel off-balance, Roy threw the Poké Ball at it before it could hit the ground, saving it and adding it to his <a href=# title=Party>team</a>.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=With_Roy>With Roy</span></h4><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/f/f8/Roy_Wattrel_Wind_Power.png/375px-Roy_Wattrel_Wind_Power.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Powering up from the wind<p>In <i><a href=# title=HZ016>Quaxly, We Can Do It</a></i>, Wattrel was used in a battle against <a href=# title=Spinel>Spinel</a>'s Magneton alongside Fuecoco. During the battle, Wattrel started a fight with Fuecoco which caused the latter to aim an Ember at Wattrel, unintentionally hitting Magneton instead, taking it out instantly. After Magneton was defeated, the two teammates continued their squabble, which caused Roy to break up the fight and temporarily leave the battle.</p><p>As their bickering continued in the <a href=# title=HZ017>next episode</a>, Roy was inspired by <a href=# title=Friede>Friede</a> to have them battle together in order to deepen their friendship and relieve some stress. Their opponent was <a href=# title="Captain Pikachu">Captain Pikachu</a>, to whom they lost due to their lack of teamwork. Immediately after, the <a href=# title="Brave Olivine">Brave Olivine</a> flew through a turbulence, during which Wattrel used its ability to catch the wind and produce electricity in order to boost its <a href=# title="Spark (move)">Spark</a> and protect Roy from getting hit by a rogue tree branch. Seeing this as an opportunity to overpower Captain Pikachu, Roy asked <a href=# title=Dot>Dot</a> for advice, which lead him, Wattrel, and Fuecoco to train the entire night in preparation for a combo move. The next day, they had their rematch against Captain Pikachu, with Fuecoco launching it and its teammate up by firing <a href=# title="Ember (move)">Embers</a> downward in order to give Wattrel enough height to catch sufficiently strong winds and activate its Ability. Despite their improved teamwork, Captain Pikachu won once again, though their relationship was shown to have grown more amicable.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=HZ023>Fiery Galarian Moltres</a></i>, Wattrel teamed up with <a href=# title="Friede's Charizard">Charizard</a> to help <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Liko's Sprigatito">Liko's Sprigatito</a> use its sweet scent and <a href=# title="Leafage (move)">Leafage</a> to sooth a <a href=# title="Galarian form">Galarian</a> <a href=# title="Moltres (Pokémon)">Moltres</a> at the <a href=# title="Galar Mine">Galar Mine</a>.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=HZ028>The Stolen Treasure</a></i>, Wattrel and Fuecoco teamed up with Sprigatito to battle <a href=# title=Tepen>Tepen</a> in order to get the Ancient Poké Ball back from him, after he stole it from Roy. However, the three of them were put to sleep by Tepen's special <a href=# title="Sleep Powder (move)">Sleep Powder</a> that his <a href=# title="Foongus (Pokémon)">Foongus</a> used.</p><p>In <a href=# title=HZ044>HZ044</a>, Roy used Wattrel to delay the <a href=# title=Explorers>Explorers</a>' coordinated attack against the <a href=# title="Black Rayquaza">Black Rayquaza</a>. During the battle, Wattrel deflected an <a href=# title="Ultra Ball">Ultra Ball</a> that <a href=# title=Chalce>Chalce</a> threw at Rayquaza with <a href=# title="Spark (move)">Spark</a>, but was then easily defeated by her <a href=# title="Medicham (Pokémon)">Medicham</a>.<br clear=all></p><p>In <a href=# title=HZ048>HZ048</a>, Wattrel was borrowed by Dot during the making of her art project for the annual <a href=# title="Artazon Art Festival">Artazon Art Festival</a>, where it produced electricity to light up her ferris wheel while <a href=# title="Dot's Quaxly">Quaxly</a> used <a href=# title="Water Gun (move)">Water Gun</a> to make it turn, which also caused the water and electricity to sparkle together.</p><p>In <a href=# title=HZ052>HZ052</a>, Wattrel accompanied its Trainer on a Pokémon research project, trying to help him to get a Grepa Berry only to get outdone by Fuecoco, inciting its jealously. It flew away on its own and practiced hard at night to try and get <a href=# title=Berry>Berries</a> more easily, but soon got into another fight with Fuecoco once again the next day. It soon helped rescue a wild <a href=# title="Capsakid (Pokémon)">Capsakid</a> from a cliff then tried to rescue Roy when he lost his grip but was blown away by strong wind currents. When Roy fell from the cliff, Wattrel soon gathered all of its strength and evolved into Kilowattrel, diving down and rescuing its Trainer, while also showing off its newfound strength and flying prowess by flying Roy around the area before landing. Afterwards, Kilowattrel gave Fuecoco a ride on its back while flying for fun, reconciling their friendship.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Personality_and_characteristics>Personality and characteristics</span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/6/6e/Roy_Wattrel_fear.png/375px-Roy_Wattrel_fear.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Wattrel's fear of heights<p>Like <a href=# title="Roy's Fuecoco">Roy's Fuecoco</a>, Kilowattrel has shown to be gluttonous. In its <a href=# title=HZ013>debut</a> as a Wattrel, it was seen stealing the <a href=# title="Pokémon category">Fire Croc Pokémon</a>'s <a href=# title=Sandwich>sandwich</a>. Wattrel also enjoys eating <a href=# title=Berry>Berries</a>. Despite being a <a href=# title="Flying (type)">Flying</a> <a href=# title=Type>type</a>, it initially had a fear of heights, but it managed to overcome its <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:acrophobia>acrophobia</a> with Roy's help. After flying for the first time, Wattrel came to enjoy it. Wattrel also became fascinated in seeing other Flying types fly, as shown in <i><a href=# title=HZ015>Someone We Can't See! Whosawhatsit?</a></i>, when it tried to follow a <a href=# title="Wild Pokémon">wild</a> <a href=# title="Corvisquire (Pokémon)">Corvisquire</a>. In addition, Wattrel enjoys the sunlight and doesn’t like when someone blocks the sun. Wattrel is noticeably smaller than others of its <a href=# title="Wattrel (Pokémon)">species</a> and has perpetually squinted eyes.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/f/f7/Roy_Fuecoco_and_Kilowattrel.png/375px-Roy_Fuecoco_and_Kilowattrel.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Kilowattrel and Fuecoco<p>At first, Wattrel wasn't interested in Roy, acting aggressively towards him even when he tried to share his food with it. However, after Roy helped it learn to fly and overcome its fear of heights, Wattrel took a liking to him and refused to leave his side, as it immediately flew back to him when he tried to walk away, which led him to catching it. After being caught, Wattrel became very affection towards Roy, as it enjoys being with him, even though it had trouble interacting with him whenever he sang Fuecoco. Wattrel also would put Roy's safety first before its own, as shown in <i><a href=# title=HZ017>Special Training Time!</a></i>, when it saved its Trainer from getting hit by a branch when the <a href=# title="Brave Olivine">Brave Olivine</a> was experiencing turbulence. Wattrel also craves Roy's validation and becomes deeply upset when it feels that it is not worthy, such as when Roy and Fuecoco tried singing a song to cheer it up despite it failing in its goal to overcome the wind.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/0/04/Wattrel_admired_HZ051.png/375px-Wattrel_admired_HZ051.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>Wattrel has shown to get jealous of other Pokémon interacting with Roy, as it doesn't seem to like sharing its Trainer with others, especially with Fuecoco, even though it knows that he has been with their Trainer longer than it has. Wattrel would show its jealousy by breaking into an <a href=# title="Uproar (move)">Uproar</a>. At first, Wattrel didn't get along with Fuecoco because he kept getting in its personal space and was envious of his <a href=# title=Friendship>bond</a> with Roy, which led it to fight with its teammate. However, after growing closer as a team, Wattrel felt accepted enough to join Roy and Fuecoco in their singing amicably. Although it has gotten along better with Fuecoco, Wattrel still fights with its teammate, as shown in <i><a href=# title=HZ023>Fiery Galarian Moltres</a></i>, when it fought with him for a <a href=# title="Grepa Berry">Grepa Berry</a>. After evolving into Kilowattrel, it and Fuecoco are on much better terms, as it doesn't mind caring its teammate on its back whenever he needed to fly.</p><p>Upon witnessing <a href=# title="Captain Pikachu">Captain Pikachu</a>'s <a href=# title="Electric (type)">Electric-type</a> moves, Wattrel started to admire him and aspired to be able to use its electricity to a similar degree. It is also shown to not give up easily and is brave at heart, seen when it endlessly trained to overcome the strong winds and impress Roy, as well as when it used all of its strength to evolve and rescue its Trainer from falling off a cliff with no hesitation. After its evolution, Kilowattrel still retains its proud attitude but has become more mature as well.</p><p>Before it's evolution, Wattrel was a relatively weak flyer, possibly due to its former fear of heights, as it struggled to fly high in the sky due to strong winds. However, after endlessly training to overcome it's weakness, it became strong enough to carry a <a href=# title="Capsakid (Pokémon)">Capsakid</a> up a cliff to safety. Upon evolution, its strength increased drastically, as it now could carry Roy against the winds without any issue.<br clear=all></p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Appearance>Appearance</span></h3><table><tbody><tr><th>As a Wattrel</th></tr><tr><td><a href=# class=image><img alt="Roy Wattrel.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/e/e8/Roy_Wattrel.png/375px-Roy_Wattrel.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Moves_used>Moves used</span></h3><table class=roundy><tbody readability=3.4146341463415><tr readability=2.34375><td><table><tbody readability=1><tr readability=2><td class=roundy><table class=roundy><tbody readability=1><tr><td><a href=# class=image><img alt="Roy Wattrel Uproar.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/c/cf/Roy_Wattrel_Uproar.png/300px-Roy_Wattrel_Uproar.png decoding=async width=200 height=113 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td align=center>Using Uproar as a Wattrel</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td class=roundy></td></tr><tr readability=4><td colspan=2 class=roundy>A <b><span>†</span></b> shows that the move was used recently, unless all moves fit this case or there are fewer than five known moves.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Gallery>Gallery</span></h3><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Artwork>Artwork</span></h4><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Eyecatches>Eyecatches</span></h4><table><tbody><tr><td><a href=# class=image><img alt="HZ eyecatch Roy Wattrel.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/d/d0/HZ_eyecatch_Roy_Wattrel.png/390px-HZ_eyecatch_Roy_Wattrel.png decoding=async width=260 height=146 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=mw-headline id=In_the_manga>In the manga</span></h2><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/2/23/Roy_Wattrel_HZM.png/255px-Roy_Wattrel_HZM.png decoding=async width=170 height=113 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Wattrel in Pocket Monsters<h3><span class=mw-headline id=Pocket_Monsters>Pocket Monsters</span></h3><p><a href=# title="Wattrel (Pokémon)">Wattrel</a> debuted in <a href=# title=HZM02>HZM02</a> battling <a href=# title=Lucius>Lucius</a>'s <a href=# title="Galarian form">Galarian</a> <a href=# title="Moltres (Pokémon)">Moltres</a>.</p><p>In <a href=# title=HZM03>HZM03</a>, Wattrel appeared again in a flashback.<br clear=all></p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Trivia>Trivia</span></h2><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Related_articles>Related articles</span></h2><p>For more information on this Pokémon's species, see <a href=# title="Wattrel (Pokémon)">Wattrel</a> and <a href=# title="Kilowattrel (Pokémon)">Kilowattrel</a>.<br clear=all></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorzEnaCaZpKquaOtxpqpnZ2eY7umwI6woKShX4e8unGRcKqYg5mhvLit062pnqQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
