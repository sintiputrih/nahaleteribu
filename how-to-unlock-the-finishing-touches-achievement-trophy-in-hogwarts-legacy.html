Achieving this accomplishment requires casting Ancient Magic on “every enemy in the game.” From a glance, such an objective might appear to be daunting, as your Collection logs for enemy mobs will display dozens of entries. However, the required mobs for “Finishing Touches” does not include one-time enemies like Trial guardians or phantoms of Death. Conversely, there are 34 enemies that you must track down for this Achievement/Trophy, all of which can be encountered in the open world of the Highlands.</p><p data-injection=true><strong>Related:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">All landing platform locations in Hogwarts Legacy</a></p><h2>Casting Ancient Magic for Finishing Touches in Hogwarts Legacy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Defeating-a-Poacher-Duellist-with-Ancient-Magic-in-Hogwarts-Legacy.jpg><p data-injection=true>You will learn to cast Ancient Magic during the “Welcome to Hogsmeade”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Main Quest in Hogwarts Legacy</a>.

You can collect this essence by picking up the glowing orbs that drop from enemies during combat or by using your Spells to strike your opponents.

After destroying the 20 vases surrounding the site’s statue, you can enter the arena and face a Armoured Troll as your first opponent.</p><h3>Venomous Ambusher Location for Finishing Touches in Hogwarts Legacy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Venomous-Ambusher-Map-Location-for-Finishing-Touches-Achievement-Trophy-in-Hogwarts-Legacy.jpg><p data-injection=true>The next two enemy types you need to use Ancient Magic on are the Venomous and Thornback arachnid families. After defeating the Fortified Troll in the Feldcroft&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Arena</a>, continue fighting through the hordes of enemies until Wave 4. This wave of foes includes a Venomous Ambusher, another hard-to-find mob that is a guaranteed spawn in this combat instance.</p><h3>Venomous Matriarch Location for Finishing Touches in Hogwarts Legacy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Venomous-Matriarch-Map-Location-for-Finishing-Touches-Achievement-Trophy-in-Hogwarts-Legacy.jpg><p data-injection=true>You can encounter a Venomous Matriarch in the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider Lair</a>&nbsp;southeast of the North Ford Bog Entrance Floo Flame in Hogwarts Legacy.

The first is the Thornback Ambusher, a spider variant that can be found in Spider Lair atop the ridge west of the Coastal Mine Floo Flame in the Marunweem Lake region.</p><h3>Thornback Scurriour Location for Finishing Touches in Hogwarts Legacy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Thornback-Scurriour-Map-Location-for-Finishing-Touches-Achievement-Trophy-in-Hogwarts-Legacy.jpg><p data-injection=true>If you are looking for Thornback Scurriours, you can investigate the unmarked half of the Spider Lair, where you encountered the Venomous Matriarch and Scurriour near the North Ford Bog Entrance. While the in-game map does not explicitly reveal the western section of the Lair, the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">underground location</a>&nbsp;does serve as a den for several Thornback Scurriours in Hogwarts Legacy.</p><h3>Thornback Shooter Location for Finishing Touches in Hogwarts Legacy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Thornback-Shooter-Map-Location-for-Finishing-Touches-Achievement-Trophy-in-Hogwarts-Legacy.jpg><p data-injection=true>A Thornback Shooter can also be found within the same Lair where you encounter the Thornback Scurriours by the North Ford Bog Entrance. As their name implies, Thornback Shooters will typically keep their distance when attacking, so&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">using a magical Spell</a>&nbsp;like Accio might come in handy.</p><h3>Thornback Matriarch Location for Finishing Touches in Hogwarts Legacy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Thornback-Matriarch-Map-Location-for-Finishing-Touches-Achievement-Trophy-in-Hogwarts-Legacy.jpg><p data-injection=true>Unfortunately, you will not encounter a Thornback Matriarch in the same Spider Lair as the Venomous Matriarch. Instead, you need to travel to the West Hogwarts Valley and fly north up the mountain slope. After you go past the tree line and have a clear view of Hogwarts, head toward the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Treasure Vault</a>&nbsp;nearby to find a Spider Lair near its entrance guarded by a Thornback Matriarch.&nbsp;</p><h3>Stoneback Dugbog Location for Finishing Touches in Hogwarts Legacy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Stoneback-Dugbog-Map-Location-for-Finishing-Touches-Achievement-Trophy-in-Hogwarts-Legacy.jpg><p data-injection=true>The last enemies you must use Ancient Magic on for the “Finishing Touches” Achievement/Trophy in Hogwarts Legacy are Dugbogs, giant amphibians that reside in Dugbug Lairs across the map. To locate a Stoneback Dugbog, travel to the Irondale Floo Flame and ride your Broom southward. If you investigate the beach at the bottom of the ridge next to the nearby&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ancient Magic Hotspot</a>, you will find several Stoneback Dugbogs.</p><h3>Cottongrass Dugbog Location for Finishing Touches in Hogwarts Legacy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Cottongrass-Dugbog-Map-Location-for-Finishing-Touches-Achievement-Trophy-in-Hogwarts-Legacy.jpg><p data-injection=true>At the same Dugbog Lair mentioned above, you can also encounter a Cottongrass Dugbog in Hogwarts Legacy. This variant is slightly tougher than Stonebacks, but you should have no trouble taking it down if you&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cast Levioso</a>&nbsp;whenever it attempts to attack you with its tongue.</p><h3>Great Spined Dugbog Location for Finishing Touches in Hogwarts Legacy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Great-Spined-Dugbog-Map-Location-for-Finishing-Touches-Achievement-Trophy-in-Hogwarts-Legacy.jpg><p data-injection=true>For the Great Spined Dugbog, you must travel to the West Hogwarts Valley Floo Flame and follow the main road to the east. After several dozen yards, you will come upon a Dugbog Lair with an army of Great Spined Dugbogs.</p><p>As noted at the start, it is not necessary to land the killing blow with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ancient Magic</a>&nbsp;to progress “Finishing Touches” in Hogwarts Legacy. As long as you activate the prompt and use an Ancient Magic attack once on one of the enemies above, you can confidently move on to the next target. Another detail to note is that you can encounter every open-world mob in multiple locations. As a result, many players likely have already used Ancient Magic on most of the creatures and humanoids in this list.</p><p>For simplicity’s sake, we used specific locations in the list above, allowing you to easily pinpoint the spot of every mob you need to find for the “Finishing Touches”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Achievement/Trophy in Hogwarts Legacy</a>. Therefore, if you have forgotten if you used Ancient Magic on an enemy, you use the provided Highlands locations to quickly navigate to the site and cast engage in combat to “double-check” your Achievement/Trophy’s progression.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f6e972bb77b34c79a80d8d17f501a391?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Ethan Webb</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>From spending endless hours discovering secrets in Paper Mario: TTYD to farming monster parts for a new Bowgun in Monster Hunter Rise, Ethan has always been a gaming enthusiast who passionately loves what he writes about.
