It’s a testament to a strong group of characters and an engaging story about cattle ranching, something that you wouldn’t quite expect to merit such a twisting and turning plot. And off of that success, Sheridan and company are launching a Yellowstone prequel, 1883 which will feature a star-studded cast of its own. According to <a href=#>Deadline</a>, after adding some big leads to the production, the rest of the cast has now been filled out as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Yellowstone 1883 had already added some heavy hitters to its production that is set to take place in the titular year. Tim McGraw and Faith Hill are going to play the main couple, the Duttons who are the great-grandparents of Kevin Costner’s character in the original series. And there are also going to be folks like Sam Elliott, Billy Bob Thornton, <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Isabel May" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Isabel May</a>, and LaMonica Garrett. On Thursday, the rest of the cast was rounded out with the series adding a number of other actors and actresses to the ranks. By the looks of things, this is going to be another sweeping story.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of the announcement, Yellowstone 1883 added a number of new faces. The young Audie Rick will play John Dutton Sr. the grandfather of Costner’s character. Marc Rissman and Annie Fiamora will play Josef and Risa, European immigrants who are part of the traveling party in the show. Eric Nelsen and James Landry Hebert will play younger cowboys in the series. Other additions to the cast include Emma Malouff, Dawn Olivieri, Alex Fine, Gratiela Brancusi, Stephanie Nur, Nichole Galicia, Amanda Jaros, Noah Le Gros, and Martin Senmeier. Again, this is shaping up to be a huge series for Paramount+, capitalizing on how much the original series has captured a certain sense of story and place.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Yellowstone 1883 is set to follow the Dutton clan as they make their way west across the frontier looking for a place to settle. Because the Costner-led series establishes that the Duttons were ultimately successful in their venture considering his character and family own the largest contiguous ranch in the United States, this new series will detail just what it took to get that started.&nbsp; If the original show is any indication, this one won’t pull any punches on the brutality of both the landscape, but also the power and ego involved with these ventures.&nbsp;</p><p>And in terms of drawing viewership, there’s a good chance Yellowstone 1883 is another popular offering for Paramount+. Yellowstone just recently had a <a href=#>huge showing</a> for its Season Four premiere with the first episode landing more than 14.7 million viewers on the streamer. That represents a massive 66% increase from what they did at the beginning of Season Three. In the world of the Duttons, the stories are alive and well. And this prequel series isn’t the only spinoff in the works. There is also going to be 6666 which will tell the story of another ranch, this one in Texas.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ixlaG5sMPSraannV1mhXl%2FjJyYrKxencGuuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
