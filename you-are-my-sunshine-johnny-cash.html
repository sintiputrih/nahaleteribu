The person also lost the love of their life because the ex found love in another despite the efforts to keep the relationship alive. This makes the person heartbroken, and the dream of getting back together might not be possible anymore.</p><p>People immediately became attached to the rendition, playing it when they were sad, or their loved ones passed away. Most comments say they played Cash’s version whenever they remembered their loved ones. Johnny Cash’s deepness and calmness of his bass-baritone voice have struck people emotionally in that they would burst into tears because of the memories flooding back into their minds.</p><p>Aside from his version of “You Are My Sunshine,” <a href=#>other songs by Johnny Cash</a>, such as <a href=#>“Man in Black,”</a> “Ring of Fire,” “Get Rhythm,” and “I Walk the Line,” are famous as well.
