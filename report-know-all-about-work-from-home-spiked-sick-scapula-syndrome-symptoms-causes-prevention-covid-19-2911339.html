What is Sick scapula syndrome?

However, the current <a href=#>work from home</a> culture (WFH) with poor sitting posture or continued sitting for hours without break has led to such cases among common working people.</p><p><strong>Sick scapula syndrome - Symptoms</strong></p><p>The most common symptoms are pain and difficulty moving the shoulder or arm.</p><p>Dr Shubhang Aggarwal, Orthopaedic and Robotic Joint Replacement Surgeon and Founder, NHS Hospital, Jalandhar, said, "The number of cases of musculoskeletal issues either due to inactivity or over-exercise have been seen throughout the lockdown. And the ones related to bad posture are being seen, especially now when offline physical sitting in offices has started and the posture changes that we had adapted our bodies to during work from home, need to be changed."</p><p>"The incidence of Sick scapula syndrome, especially in the IT professionals, reception and desk workers has surprisingly increased and need sharp observation to diagnose. Once suspected, aggressive behavioural modification with exercise can help," he added.</p><p><strong>Sick scapula syndrome - All you need to know</strong></p><p>The shoulder joint is somewhat like a ball-and-socket joint and comprises three bones: the humerus (upper arm bone), the scapula (shoulder bone), and the clavicle (collarbone). The highest point of the humerus shapes the ball that sits inside the glenoid of the scapula.</p><p>While a mind-boggling arrangement of muscles and ligaments -- including the rotator cuff -- holds this ball-and-socket up, the scapula goes about as an anchor site for different muscles around the shoulder. The shoulder bone (acromion) likewise connects to the clavicle to make the acromioclavicular (AC) joint.</p><p>While sedentary work cannot be done away with, people must take adequate measures such as exercising daily, maintaining the right posture, and taking breaks from their seats in between work. Getting up from the seat and walking while taking phone calls, not using the phone, will ease the issue. Opting for a chair that delivers both support and comfort can also be beneficial, the doctors advised.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbrAoqWdoZFjsLC5jqGcmqSknXyzsc%2Boqa1lm6O8uHnApaNmmZKkwrV51qippGWWp7yueceopJ5lo6W2rLHDZqqim5tiwKStz66jmmWjrrulvs6mnGarqaK9tbvMrGScmaWosrR5z6ucr52eqbawuoycpq%2BhlGJ%2BenmRcmhqa2Nu</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
