Mr. Darby was reportedly found fooling around in Grindr; a gay dating app. Along with it, Michael was rumored to be in love with &nbsp;Juan Dixon.</p><p>Back in 2020 when Ashley featured in <a href=# rel=noopener>The Sarah Fraiser Show</a>, the RHOP got bombarded with questions regarding the very situation. Fraiser threw some bombing questions on Michael having a thing for Juan Dixon. In her defense, Ashley quickly retaliated saying,"“Here’s my thing, at this point, if I can be open now about my sexuality if I can be open about the fact that Michael and I have had threesomes if I am this forthcoming, it would be so much work to hide if my husband was interested in men."</p><p>Defending her husband against the allegations of him being gay, Ashley openly declared that if her husband was gay, there would be queue of people coming out the woodwork left, right and center at the point.

As per the cameraman's claims, Darby allegedly offered a "flirtatious" look after squeezing Palmer's buttocks.</p><p>When Ashely was asked about the issue, she again defended her husband claiming that it was just "white boy culture" and that it didn't matter. That didn't stop suspicions that Michael Darby had a preference for guys, and it doesn't appear that they will stop now that another charge has surfaced.</p><p>In conclusion, though there's enough evidence that Michael Darby could actually be gay, his wife insists that he is not and the restaurant owner himself hasn't come out too to prove the claims right.</p><h2>Michael Darby and Ashely Darby have split!
