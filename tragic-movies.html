However, the film fails to portray the true <a href=# rel=noopener>horror</a> of the genocide and its aftermath. Lately, the film has been accused of only telling one side of the story, that of protagonist Rusesabagina.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-139906 alt="Convoy of trucks passes Rwandan refugees" width=900 height=586 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/water-for-refugees.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-139906 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>A convoy of fresh water is brought to the Rwandan refugees located at Camp Kimbumba, Zaire in 2007.</span></p><p>The survivors of the genocide have recently accused Rusesabagina of money extortion. According to some Tutsi survivors, Rusesabagina demanded money from them in return for their survival. It has even been alleged that Rusesabagina did everything he could to remove UN peacekeepers from the hotel’s entrance and provided Rwandan Army commanders with lists of those sheltering in his hotel.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-139907 alt="Destroyed church in from the Rwandan genocide" width=900 height=599 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ntrama-church.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-139907 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>5,000 people seeking refuge in this house of God were killed by grenade, machete, rifle and were burned alive.

In reality it was more of a “looting zone” where both Ruseabagina and his wife had to forage for food in order to avoid starvation. He accused the film’s directors of creating a Hollywood style “happy ending” for the film, where in reality there was none.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1vsCgoJxlnaTDqrHSaGs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
