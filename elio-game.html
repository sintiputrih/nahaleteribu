The following day, Hau tells Elio of an emergency and that they need to go to the Marina in Hau'oli immediately. It turns out that Lillie is leaving Alola to go to Kanto, and Elio has to say goodbye. After seeing his friend leave, Professor Kukui brings Elio back home.</p><p>Elio appears in the credits on a photo on the end screen, a photo that he, Hau and Lillie all took at Hau'oli City from the start of their journey. This photo is a part of an animated sequence. This sequence has a package sitting next to Lillie's pink rucksack. The contents of this package include the photo (among many others) that Elio, Hau and Lillie took at Hau'oli City; Selene's trial amulet, and a letter to Lillie. A quote, "<i>Everyone's smiles shine so brightly. Those smiles led us to so many other people. And those meetings will lead us to a bright future. I'm so glad I got to meet everyone. I'm so glad I got to meet you.</i>" is displayed over an image of Lillie and Nebby before this sequence, it can be assumed that she is either talking about the player or Nebby.

He successfully uses Nebby's powers to travel to this alternate world, leaving Lillie and Elio to figure out how to follow her.

Elio successfully defeats Hau one last time, making him the first Champion of Alola.</p><p>Later, Elio assists the Ultra Recon Squad in catching some Ultra Beasts roaming around Poni Island.
