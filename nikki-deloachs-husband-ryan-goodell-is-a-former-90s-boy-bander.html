In 1997, Ryan joined the all-male band called Take 5, created by '90s boy band aficionado Lou Pearlman. The band consisted of Goodell's brother, Jeff "Clay" Goodell, along with members Tilky Jones, Stevie Scunthorpe, and TJ Christofore. While Take 5 was popular and had hits such as "I Give" and "The Tide is High," they never rose to the level of their <a href=#>competitors NSYNC and Backstreet Boys</a>. They disbanded in 2000 due to issues with Pearlman.</p><p dir=ltr>The Goodell brothers' mother, Merrily Goodell, filed a complaint with the Florida Department of Labor, claiming that Pearlman didn't adhere to labor laws protecting minors from working more than a certain number of hours and not providing the band members with tutors, as reported by the <a href=#>Orlando Sentinel</a>. "I abhor what this man has done, and I think he's done it again and again and again. He exploits minors to further his own career interests," Merrily stated. She also claimed that Take 5 members didn't receive any royalty checks from Pearlman.</p><p dir=ltr>After Take 5 disbanded, the members went their separate ways and went on to pursue other careers. Ryan never made it back to the spotlight but he found another way to stay in the entertainment industry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamplZ356g46noKSjmWKxprjOmpqhq12dwrSuwKebZqqplrtus86om56knGK2tHnAZp2oqp2av26Fj6xkm6epYq%2BiusOeqWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
