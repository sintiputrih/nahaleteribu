Peyton is on hosting duties, while his <a href=#>older brother Cooper</a> appears as his fun and gregarious sidekick.</p><p>Do Cooper and Peyton Manning have any more <a href=#>siblings</a>?

The former quarterback — who played for a total of 18 seasons — is a two-time Super Bowl Champion and in 2021, his athletic achievements were recognized with his induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</p><p>But Peyton's brothers are rather accomplished as well.</p><p>Big brother Cooper Manning, who appears alongside Peyton on NBC’s Capital One College Bowl, is the oldest of the Manning kids. Like his siblings and their father, Archie Manning, Cooper also had what appeared to be a promising career in football.</p><p>He was committed to the University of Mississippi but after he felt numbness in his fingers and toes during practice, he was taken to the hospital where he was diagnosed with spinal stenosis, a narrowing of the spinal canal that leads to pinched nerves.</p><p>Cooper moved on from football and continues to live a happy life. He’s been married to his wife, Ellen Heidingsfelder, since 1999 and the couple share three kids: May, Arch, and Heid.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>After middle child Peyton comes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eli Manning</a>, the youngest of the Manning brothers. Eli has also had an extremely successful career in the NFL and is considered by many to be the greatest quarterback in the history of the New York Giants franchise.</p><p>Like his brother Peyton, Eli has two Super Bowl Championships under his belt, but unlike his brother, Eli is one of only five players in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL history</a> to win multiple Super Bowl MVPs. When Eli announced his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">retirement</a> in 2020, John Mara, president and CEO of the Giants, said that Eli would be inducted into the Giants Ring of Honor and that his No. 10 jersey would be retired. Many people also think Eli could be a shoo-in for the next round of inductions into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</p><p>As for Eli’s personal life, he is married to his University of Mississippi sweetheart, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Abby McGraw</a>. The two married in 2008 in a private ceremony in Mexico and now have four children: Lucy Thomas Manning, Ava Frances Manning, Charles Elisha Manning, and Caroline Olivia Manning.</p><p>Watch new episodes of the Capital One College Bowl on NBC every Tuesday at 10 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbK6wM6nZKaZnqO2r7OMrKCbpJmjtLQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
