03:04PM EDT - Sweeney: the next-gen of games will be developer centric, not retail centric
03:04PM EDT - Sweeney: it's a great time to be a game developer, distribution systems like steam (or just the web), not having to deal with the publisher or retailer you can do an enormous amount and build a company now like I did Epic back in 1991 without investors, this is a great time for this, the pace of innovation in the industry with mobile devices and oculus it's going to be a very interesting time to see all of this come together"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Sweeney: it's a great time to be a game developer, distribution systems like steam (or just the web), not having to deal with the publisher or retailer you can do an enormous amount and build a company now like I did Epic back in 1991 without investors, this is a great time for this, the pace of innovation in the industry with mobile devices and oculus it's going to be a very interesting time to see all of this come together</p><p><a id=post1018150332 href=#><span class=lb_time>03:03PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: all of us our building the future we want to see</p><p><a id=post1018150320 href=#><span class=lb_time>03:03PM EDT</span></a> - If there's anything in the game industry you'd hold your breath for a decade for, what would it be?</p><p><a id=post1018150307 href=#><span class=lb_time>03:03PM EDT</span></a> - Johan: I'll use both</p><p><a id=post1018150302 href=#><span class=lb_time>03:03PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: I've got a lightboost monitor on my desktop, it'll probably move to G-Sync</p><p><a id=post1018150245 href=#><span class=lb_time>03:02PM EDT</span></a> - Sweeney: we primarily use NV hardware at Epic, and we buy most of it</p><p><a id=post1018150227 href=#><span class=lb_time>03:02PM EDT</span></a> - NV: we haven't precluded that</p><p><a id=post1018150217 href=#><span class=lb_time>03:02PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: is G-Sync hardware licensable?</p><p><a id=post1018150208 href=#><span class=lb_time>03:02PM EDT</span></a> - Johan: I would play the game on both</p><p><a id=post1018150126 href=#><span class=lb_time>03:01PM EDT</span></a> - Is it thus fair to say that you'll be playing the games you're developing on NVIDIA hardware from this point on due to the enthusiasm for G-Sync?</p><p><a id=post1018150124 href=#><span class=lb_time>03:01PM EDT</span></a> - Ryan: Me too!</p><p><a id=post1018150038 href=#><span class=lb_time>03:00PM EDT</span></a> - I sort of want all life decisions to be handled by a panel consisting of Tim Sweeney, Johan Andersson and John Carmack</p><p><a id=post1018145804 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:58PM EDT</span></a> - Everyone seems to agree that Mantle alone isn't bad, if everyone builds their own it's bad, but hopefully it influences OpenGL/DX direction</p><p><a id=post1018145728 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:57PM EDT</span></a> - Sweeney is totally taking over the control of the panel now and asking everyone else questions this is awesome</p><p><a id=post1018145706 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:57PM EDT</span></a> - Johan: We see lots of stalls, performance gone missing, we want to learn how to program a machine on a really low level that has a good architecture for it</p><p><a id=post1018145648 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:56PM EDT</span></a> - Johan: They wouldn't have to pay us anything to use it, I've been pitching these ideas to any vendor for years</p><p><a id=post1018145631 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:56PM EDT</span></a> - Can you tell us how much they paid for you to use Mantle?</p><p><a id=post1018145441 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:54PM EDT</span></a> - He will magically know the answer at AMD's developer conference?</p><p><a id=post1018145432 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:54PM EDT</span></a> - Wow it sounds like Johan just played the NDA card on Sweeney??</p><p><a id=post1018145421 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:54PM EDT</span></a> - Johan: it's too early to quantify that, we'll have a lot more info in mid-November</p><p><a id=post1018145406 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:54PM EDT</span></a> - Sweeney: Johan, you've used the API, what's the cost in man-years and ultimate gain of using Mantle?</p><p><a id=post1018145345 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:53PM EDT</span></a> - Johan: if NV and Intel and Qualcomm did their own APIs, that would be a bad future, MS and Khronos play an important part in all of this, I hope Mantle will be quite influential in many of these aspects, what we're doing with AMD is just a start</p><p><a id=post1018145301 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:53PM EDT</span></a> - Johan: it's not a replacement, the idea is that we can solve some of the long term problems we have been having on the PC, those are things we can experiment and work with Mantle, this is another avenue, opening up something we're quite familiar with, we've spent the last few years working on next-gen consoles, even though we're not done with our work with it, I still see it as a success even right now because of these conversations and the amount of development and enthusiasm (and the opposite) - it's been a bit stale in the PC graphics space, MS switched focus for quite some time, but now going forward it's an exciting opportunity</p><p><a id=post1018145122 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:51PM EDT</span></a> - Sweeney: there's some good ideas in Mantle we really liked the idea of having low overhead access to the GPU, if you look back at DX/OGL, there's a lot of overhead in those APIs and the fact that they date back to the old SGI model of rendering which is very different than the current model, potentially unified memory, good ideas there I hope it really helps the OGL community and MS evolve their APIs. Would I like to have a low level API? Yes. Five of them? Absolutely not. To have yet another API on the PC that's still different than the DX API and OpenGL, and OpenGL ES and different than PS4 low level API, I don't think it's a good idea.</p><p><a id=post1018144946 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:49PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: Mantle only became interesting because of their dual console wins, the landscape does matter that they have both major console wins with similar architectures, not a stupid thing that AMD is doing at this point, could have some implications for Steam, if MS and Sony embraced it that would be very powerful for AMD but it doesn't look like they're going to (at least MS), if I was still doing all of the major tech coding I probably would not be embracing Mantle right now but there would be days where it would be extremely tempting</p><p><a id=post1018144836 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:48PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: My opinion is, in terms of action items, should NV have a response to Mantle? Unequivocally no, a horrible mistake if NV got panicked by this and made some lower level API, you already have good low level access through NV GPU extensions, give you as much performance as you want if you're fine with proprietary extensions</p><p><a id=post1018144753 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:47PM EDT</span></a> - What do you think of AMD's Mantle?</p><p><a id=post1018144652 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:46PM EDT</span></a> - Sweeney: when you get 20 TFLOPS in a single GPU, that's when you want to go 4K</p><p><a id=post1018144641 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:46PM EDT</span></a> - Sweeney: I see 4K as a workstation application for the next few years, we'll use those monitors for building games, but I don't think it's the right output resolution for rendering until you get significantly faster GPUs for rendering</p><p><a id=post1018144608 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:46PM EDT</span></a> - NV: it's a good thing that it doesn't have to be either or...</p><p><a id=post1018144559 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:45PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: for a conventional desktop monitor, I want to see this absolutely ubiquitous</p><p><a id=post1018144520 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:45PM EDT</span></a> - Everyone answers G-Sync</p><p><a id=post1018144512 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:45PM EDT</span></a> - 4K vs. G-Sync what is more important to gaming?</p><p><a id=post1018144500 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:45PM EDT</span></a> - Johan is talking about the idea of having a GPU server in the home and use it to handle all rendering for all of your devices at home</p><p><a id=post1018144253 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:42PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: another platform issue that's relevant to G-Sync, cloud gaming, I still think cloud gaming is going to be very important, it has immense convenience factors, G-Sync will be very useful for that since you already have enough latency and tear horribly</p><p><a id=post1018144117 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:41PM EDT</span></a> - Johan: PC has moved from grey box to something that looks like an Ultrabook, then you have lots of nice black boxes with graphics cards in it, not the same old boring boxes</p><p><a id=post1018144049 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:40PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: MS or Sony would not approve an Oculus device plugged into consoles, no opportunity to do something off the beaten path like that, large scale macro economic trends in PCs, I really have no idea</p><p><a id=post1018143949 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:39PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: it's not inconceivable that something like Steambox could come along and be the most cost effective way to deliver good computing for games</p><p><a id=post1018143835 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:38PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: in many ways I look at the PC as the muscle car/hotrod of gaming, you got the people who just want their honda civic (they have a shiny phone or console), clearly the PC ecosystem has warts on it, the fact that you can put together that system there, you don't need to be a conglomerate with a research lab, you can just buy the cards and plug them all together that's pretty awesome</p><p><a id=post1018143514 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:35PM EDT</span></a> - Sweeney: other platforms come and go, smartphones/tablets are here forever but it's purely a content consumption tool, when we go to really participate deeply in complex games, or have a long experience or build a game it's always going to be on a computer of some sort</p><p><a id=post1018143442 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:34PM EDT</span></a> - Sweeney: the very fact that the whole thing works is critically important is going to be a big driver in the growth of the PC as a gaming platform</p><p><a id=post1018143422 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:34PM EDT</span></a> - Sweeney: when you need to do really serious work we always go back to our PCs, everything we do tends to gravitate around PC, it can be depressing as the PC market ebbs and flows, quality of drivers has really changed dramatically, things generally work - even the lowest end Intel integrated laptop you can go out and buy, it works</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/7437/DSC_3628_575px.JPG alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a id=post1018143214 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:32PM EDT</span></a> - Johan is quite positive</p><p><a id=post1018143210 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:32PM EDT</span></a> - Question about the future of the PC as a gaming platform?</p><p><a id=post1018143025 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:30PM EDT</span></a> - Now Carmack gets to use the bathroom</p><p><a id=post1018143016 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:30PM EDT</span></a> - Jen-Hsun is thanking the trio for everything they've done for the game industry</p><p><a id=post1018142941 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:29PM EDT</span></a> - Jen-Hsun has to catch a flight, thanking everyone now</p><p><a id=post1018142932 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:29PM EDT</span></a> - Oh wait, Jen-Hsun stopped him</p><p><a id=post1018142924 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:29PM EDT</span></a> - He just walked off the stage</p><p><a id=post1018142915 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:29PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack asked for a bathroom break</p><p><a id=post1018142908 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:29PM EDT</span></a> - Sweeney: memory bw seems to be in good balance as long as you're using your mobile device as it's built, once you start streaming to a TV you're going to want more, a lot of our techniques that we're using aren't translatable to a mobile platform, it's just too slow due to bandwidth limitations. bw also translates into power right now, die stacking is going to be very interesting</p><p><a id=post1018142747 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:27PM EDT</span></a> - Johan: A lot of vendors on mobile with varying graphics architectures, unclear what the best type of model for overall chipset, we may have to switch the pipeline quite significantly in hardware/software</p><p><a id=post1018142716 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:27PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: in the old days it was exciting to hear Intel talk about getting things like FPUs, it's been a while since I've cared. one of those things I don't need to pay attention to since it's pretty adequate. I'm dearly looking forward to the day when we get to quantum nano tech that gets us 50GHz CPUs, but I'm not holding my breath.</p><p><a id=post1018142625 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:26PM EDT</span></a> - Is CPU power/memory bandwidth expanding quickly enough to accommodate a GPU like Kepler?</p><p><a id=post1018142612 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:26PM EDT</span></a> - Sweeney: important in these systems to look at how GPU is balanced with all of the other components of the system, improving the whole system level performance</p><p><a id=post1018142550 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:25PM EDT</span></a> - Sweeney: "they're losing it all in software"</p><p><a id=post1018142527 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:25PM EDT</span></a> - Sweeney: NV coming in with Kepler on mobile devices is going to be a really important thing for the whole industry, NVIDIA's unsung hero is the quality of its drivers, this is something that's really lacking in the rest of the industry, quality is there but performance overhead is severe, a lot of platforms we're losing a factor of 3 or 4 just in driver overhead. the only mobile platform we're able to run our next-gen mobile stuff on is NVIDIA's hardware</p><p><a id=post1018142358 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:23PM EDT</span></a> - Johan: we do a lot of experiments, one of the issues we're facing isn't technical, coming up with different game concepts because of differences in input paradigms and business models in mobile. difficult to break out and do these really small types of games that have interesting value there, we'll probably start seeing hybrid games</p><p><a id=post1018142218 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:22PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: slight slowing in growth of GPU power in mobile, approaching thermal/power limits, still going to have a ton of additional progress, going to be really happy if NVIDIA can capture significant marketshare with Kepler on that. I'm working with a lot of the mobile vendors on GPU stuff, but NVIDIA has dev rel, tools and driver team that's better than pretty much everyone else in the industry put together, it'd be nice to get that in mobile GPUs</p><p><a id=post1018142102 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:21PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: will we eventually end up where your only computation device is a mobile thing and some cloud assets, as far as seeing the latest Battlefield whatever on some mobile device, it's still a long ways off, you can do a UE4 demo on mobile but it's not like you just compiled for mobile on that</p><p><a id=post1018142011 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:20PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: they're still not really there (console class mobile performance), but it's a tremendous slope they're on. lots of other challenges, if you look at NV Shield, CPU/GPU are pretty potent but if you play games on there it still drops frames/hitches, due in part to power management, G-Sync would be a wonderful thing to have on those Android platforms</p><p><a id=post1018141922 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:19PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: I'm spending most of my time right now on an Android platform, I have a lot of real current experience, there's still a huge gap where the best mobile GPU now is still less than 1/10th of a pretty decent PC</p><p><a id=post1018141852 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:18PM EDT</span></a> - Next year we've got mobile Kepler, NV says it's more powerful graphically than the PS3, I'm curious when will it be viable to have games like Gears of War or Rage on a smartphone or tablet?</p><p><a id=post1018141815 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:18PM EDT</span></a> - Tim's take: we've seen this sort of problem throughout history, it's a form of artistic expression</p><p><a id=post1018141747 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:17PM EDT</span></a> - Johan's take: people complaining about violence in video games are getting older...the problem will go away eventually</p><p><a id=post1018141726 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:17PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack's take: I don't think there's a correlation, even if there was I don't think it's right to censor</p><p><a id=post1018141659 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:16PM EDT</span></a> - The trio are talking about violence in video games right now</p><p><a id=post1018141346 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:13PM EDT</span></a> - Tim Sweeney: I thought ZZT was this tradeoffs that couldn't be matched, then Minecraft comes along</p><p><a id=post1018141257 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:12PM EDT</span></a> - Tim: I grew up playing old computer games, there were some really interesting platform games - Commander Keen came along, when Doom came out I gave up on programming for a year - this is some unimaginable witchcraft</p><p><a id=post1018141226 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:12PM EDT</span></a> - Johan: massive inspiration from Unreal in Mirror's Edge, toolset overall was really inspiring and motivating for us to develop our own toolsets to focus on really great workflows for artists</p><p><a id=post1018141129 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:11PM EDT</span></a> - Johan: Both John and Tim have been massive inspiration, very early work on virtual texturing with Rage and idea of having entire worlds being textured that way, really inspiring to us</p><p><a id=post1018141101 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:11PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: I'm proud to be a peer to the people in the companies that do these products</p><p><a id=post1018141049 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:10PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: It was an issue at id software, so many years between releases, I very much did look at Gears of War, I would point out stuff to the artists. I'm very in awe of the high end titles that get made now, limited by fidelity of imagination, what artists bring to the games today I couldn't have imagined it</p><p><a id=post1018140942 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:09PM EDT</span></a> - A lot of people outside the industry think game developers are competitors, could each of you mention an influence from one or both of the other people on the panel from games they made?</p><p><a id=post1018140853 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:08PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: Rage did suffer by not having those moments where we let the frame rate drop, but I felt like it was a slippery slope</p><p><a id=post1018140830 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:08PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: it is a little unclear how you would make the cuts if you're still trying to be a 60Hz game on next-gen consoles, something like this would let lower end PCs play the same settings without falling apart like that, I'm not sure how much you'd throw in in terms of extra things, it'd be like optimizing for a niche platform at the beginning</p><p><a id=post1018140722 href=#><span class=lb_time>02:07PM EDT</span></a> - NVIDIA: pretty much game that ships already has that mode, they all have settings where you turn everything on and run it on a 4K monitor, it ain't 60Hz.

With Valve it's not like MS/Sony, I think they are going to look at this as a very long term effort, build it up over time...there's a lot of fear from the major pubs/developers of being tied down to platforms that are ultimately controlled by MS/Sony or others, it's scary, we'd like to have direct relationships with our customers, possibility of SteamOS being a truly open platform...is very interesting</p><p><a id=post1018135601 href=#><span class=lb_time>01:56PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: Valve approached id at the very beginning of Steam, asking about do we wanna put Doom 3 on Steam for launch - we said are you crazy? Clearly Valve has played a good strong long game and I'm afraid I may be at that same point right now, making your own console/OS - are you crazy? Maybe 10 years from now they'll look like brilliant prophets again. It still seems a little dicey to me (moving things to Linux), given their track record I'm a little hesitant...if it was another random company I'd be pseudo-scornful but since it's Valve I'm not</p><p><a id=post1018135446 href=#><span class=lb_time>01:54PM EDT</span></a> - Question for all 3: What do you think about Steam machines and Steam OS?</p><p><a id=post1018135427 href=#><span class=lb_time>01:54PM EDT</span></a> - Johan: We've done experiments, have pretty interesting game worlds (can imagine something like Mirror's Edge), rendering side we have a good trajectory, how does it effect our animation? Huge amounts of work to just do that for current gen consoles, but what about when you do that with VR? Takes a lot of time, not necessarily as part of the game but analyzing these things and getting people familiar, surprising amount of things that change within a game</p><p><a id=post1018135323 href=#><span class=lb_time>01:53PM EDT</span></a> - Question for Johan: How much sense does it make for a huge studio that makes mainstream games like Dice to get into VR now</p><p><a id=post1018135259 href=#><span class=lb_time>01:52PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: something that's not immediately obvious, because all of this is driven by mobile displays we're tied to the mobile dev cycle, causes a little bit of distress internally since it'd be great to ship a new headset every year but that's a big commitment</p><p><a id=post1018135223 href=#><span class=lb_time>01:52PM EDT</span></a> - Tim Sweeney: If you look at what happened with iPhone over the past few generations, I think we'll see rapid evolution of VR in a similar way</p><p><a id=post1018135203 href=#><span class=lb_time>01:52PM EDT</span></a> - Tim Sweeney: Epic is looking at this entirely on the software side, we've had the opportunity to work with a lot of the early stuff, it's mind boggling, hardware needs another generation or two, software needs a lot of work, not ready for prime time yet, Infiltrator demo on Oculus Rift is amazing, we're really exciting about where that's going, will play a major role in the entire industry. Still in the research phases now and how it fits with our engines and games</p><p><a id=post1018135102 href=#><span class=lb_time>01:51PM EDT</span></a> - Question for Tim: Speak to VR at Epic</p><p><a id=post1018135053 href=#><span class=lb_time>01:50PM EDT</span></a> - Now Q&A time</p><p><a id=post1018135037 href=#><span class=lb_time>01:50PM EDT</span></a> - Sweeney: Carmack said something clever earlier, when you put all of these technologies together you don't have a product you have a superpower</p><p><a id=post1018135019 href=#><span class=lb_time>01:50PM EDT</span></a> - Sweeney: Ultimate trajectory is you have dual 4K or 8K displays in the form factor of Oakley sunglasses</p><p><a id=post1018134958 href=#><span class=lb_time>01:49PM EDT</span></a> - Sweeney: content creation challenges are severe, next-gen game budgets are going to $100M per game</p><p><a id=post1018134927 href=#><span class=lb_time>01:49PM EDT</span></a> - Johan: Procedural amplification of content, procedurally creating things like guard rails in a racing game are easy/obvious, but we want that across an entire world</p><p><a id=post1018134823 href=#><span class=lb_time>01:48PM EDT</span></a> - Carmack: Game content creation, does it become like fab companies where only a few companies in the world do it?</p><p><a id=post1018134721 href=#><span class=lb_time>01:47PM EDT</span></a> - I can see how we render these beautiful environments, but how do we build these worlds? It's not clear whose problem this is and how to solve it</p><p><a id=post1018134700 href=#><span class=lb_time>01:47PM EDT</span></a> - Johan: I have a good idea of what we can do visually over the next 4 years, one of the hardest challenge is not necessarily the visuals but we would really like to solve how we create our content and our game worlds, that's a massive issue</p><p><a id=post1018134509 href=#><span class=lb_time>01:45PM EDT</span></a> -
