While our community mourns her untimely departure, let us remember and honor a life who made an indelible mark upon those she touched with both education and kindness.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who Was Dina Bourque?</strong></h2><p>Dina Bourque was an exceptional leader who dedicated herself to nurturing young minds throughout Iberia Parish. As principal of Iberia Middle School, her efforts went far beyond academic excellence – they focused on providing an environment in which every child felt respected and included; initiatives she spearheaded included anti-bullying campaigns as well as initiatives emphasizing kindness towards her students in today’s globalized environment. She will always be missed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why Is She Admired as Principal?</h2><p>Bourque took an holistic approach to education. She believed in providing her students with both intellectual and emotional nourishment; this philosophy made her much more than a principal; it rendered her as mentor, confidante, and role model – her genuine care for their holistic development echoed across school walls and fostered a strong community spirit that went far beyond typical teacher/student relationships.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Have the Communities Responded?</h2><p>News of Bourque’s death sent shockwaves through her community.

At once mournful yet united in strength in celebrating her legacy which encompassed kindness, compassion and a dedication towards shaping future generations.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Impact of Her Educational Philosophy</strong></h2><p>Dina Bourque was known for her revolutionary educational philosophy: kindness breeds kindness. By instilling this philosophy into her students, Dina sought to foster an environment in which students could extend this kindness far beyond school walls and become responsible members of society themselves. Anti-bullying policies promoted inclusivity beyond simply creating safe learning environments; their focus also included developing empathy in them that would prepare them to lead meaningful lives outside the school walls.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Remembering Dina Bourque</strong></h2><p>As Iberia Middle School and its wider community mourn, it is vitally important that they remember the values championed by Dina Bourque.
