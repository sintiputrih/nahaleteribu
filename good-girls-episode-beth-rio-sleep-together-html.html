During the pilot episode, <a href=#>Beth, Annie, and Ruby</a> robbed a grocery store to make ends meet. What they discovered was that the grocery store was a business front ran by Rio. Ultimately, Rio puts the girls to work to make up for the money they stole.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_64>As the season progresses, Beth and Rio become an unofficial team. Although Beth is married to <a href=#>Dean (Matthew Lillard)</a>, fans can’t help but notice the tension between her and Rio when they’re together. However, the pair never go too far with each other in season 1. Montana shared in 2020 that he enjoys keeping the viewers wondering what will happen between Rio and Beth.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_63>“[There’s] a huge cat-and-mouse game between Rio and Beth, and I feel it makes really good TV because they are both one-upping each other,” he <a href=#>told The Neil Haley show ahead of the Season 3 premiere</a>.”It’s weird because opposites attract. So they both dislike each other but love each other at the same time, so it just makes for a really complex relationship.”</p><h2 id=h-do-beth-and-rio-ever-have-sex>Do Beth and Rio ever have sex?</h2><p id=par-6_64>After one seemingly long season of sexual tension, Beth and Rio get together in season 2 of Good Girls. In <a href=#>Season 2, Episode 4</a>, “Pick Your Poison,” the twosome finally addressed the proverbial elephant in the room, per <a href=#>Bustle</a>. While spending time together at a bar, Rio eventually directed Beth to the bathroom. The pair then have sex and continue their business as usual.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_32>Rio and Beth haven’t slept together since season 2. Although they still manage to work together, <a href=#>Good Girls showrunner Jenna Bans</a> said viewers would see more of their dynamic in later seasons.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_29>“That chemistry is not something that can be snuffed out, so it brings up all of that good stuff, them working in such close proximity,” Bans told <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_51>“That’s something we’re really looking forward to jumping into in season 4 and something we’re sad we didn’t get to show the fans in season 3, but it’s all still coming,” she continued. “You don’t go from having the hottest sex of your life to wanting someone dead without conflicted feelings.”</p><h2 id=h-did-good-girls-get-canceled>Did ‘Good Girls’ get canceled?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_29>On March 7, 2021, Good Girsl returned to NBC for season 4.
