She was from Puerto Rico and made this traditional Latin flan dessert. Even though I was most likely only 8 or 9 years old, I can remember it like it was yesterday. I would pile a big dish full of her famous flan and load it with whipped cream.</p><p>I am pretty sure that I loved food straight out of the womb.</p><p>I recently ran into her at the DMV, of all places. It was so wonderful to catch up and you better believe it, I asked for her for the best flan recipe in the world. I have tried so many different flans all over the world from Mexico to Barcelona, Spain and I just couldn’t get her flan out of my mind.</p><p>After studying the recipe, I realized there was one ingredient that set it apart — cream cheese.</p><p>This began a process of playing around in the kitchen to create the&nbsp;<strong>perfect flan recipe</strong>. I made five caramel flan recipes to ensure it was absolute perfection.

It’s known for its smooth texture, velvety consistency, and perfect sweetness. Flan is typically made from simple ingredients like eggs, milk, sugar, and vanilla, but it can be made even better with an addition like cream cheese.</p><p>Flan is baked in a water bath, which involves placing the baking dish containing the flan custard inside a larger pan filled with hot water. This helps ensure even cooking and prevents the custard from curdling or overcooking. This is an essential step to making the creamiest flan.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><span><strong>Creamy Caramel Flan is a traditional Mexican, Spanish, and Puerto Rican dessert. It is a rich sweet custard baked with caramelized sugar.&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p>When I was in Barcelona, Spain, sometimes flan can be referred to as Creme Caramel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Caramel-Flan-3.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Best Flan Recipe</h2><p>By mastering the art of caramelization, perfecting the water bath method, and embracing the magic of cream cheese, you can create flan that is truly unforgettable.</p><p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center block-tip__title has-x-large-font-size">Recipe Testing Process:</h2></p><p>I have been recipe testing flan for years to get it just right! When I finally received the famous flan recipe from my neighbor, I was beyond thrilled. Here is some of the behind-the-scenes of how I tested out making the perfect flan.</p><p>I started off making a flan with 16 ounces of cream cheese which made it have a cheesecake texture. It was absolutely delicious but not a traditional flan texture. I tried to go back to the basics and tried a straight egg custard with two types of milk and even though it had silky smooth texture, I missed the creaminess.</p><p>I even tried canned coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk, and eggs to create a rich custard. It was heavenly but the coconut milk flavor came through a little too much. I am telling you…I am picky in the kitchen! So, I decided to try a combination of ingredients and techniques.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Caramel-Flan-Ingredients.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Flan Ingredients:</h2><p>The ultimate&nbsp;Creamy Caramel Flan is made with caramelized sugar, evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, a touch of cream cheese, eggs, and vanilla. The four ounces of cream cheese gives it a touch of creaminess without tasting like cheesecake.</p><p>This flan has the silkiest smooth texture and melts in your mouth. There are only 6 ingredients needed to make the best flan EVER. <strong>This is the best caramel flan recipe!</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Evaporated Milk</strong>: This canned milk provides a denser consistency compared to regular milk resulting in a smoother, creamier custard.</li><li><strong>Sweetened Condensed Milk</strong>: The concentrated sweetness of sweetened condensed milk not only adds sweetness to the flan but also contributes to its richness.</li><li><strong>Sugar</strong>: The granulated is used in two ways — it is added into the custard plus is cooked until perfectly caramelized.</li><li><strong>Eggs</strong>: This is what gives the custard the perfect texture.</li><li><strong>Cream Cheese</strong>: This is the secret, game-changing ingredient that sets this flan apart from the rest. I suggest using only full-fat, regular cream cheese.</li><li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: When making homemade flan, I like to use vanilla beans straight from the pod, vanilla bean paste, or high-quality Mexican vanilla.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Why add cream cheese to flan?</h3><p>While traditional flan is undeniably delicious, adding cream cheese takes it to a whole new level of indulgence. The cream cheese lends a subtle tanginess and a luxuriously creamy texture, elevating the dessert to new heights of decadence. Incorporating cream cheese into the custard mixture adds richness and depth of flavor, making each bite a heavenly experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Caramel-Flan-8.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Flan Tips and Tricks:</h2><p>Here are the essential tips for making the best flan. After making and recipe testing flan for years, here are the fool-proof methods for making the perfect flan recipe.</p><li><strong>Mastering the Caramel:</strong> The caramel is an integral part of flan. To achieve the perfect caramel, heat sugar in a saucepan over medium heat until it melts and turns amber in color. Be vigilant to avoid burning, as even a few seconds can ruin the caramel.</li><li><strong>Testing for Doneness: </strong>Knowing when the caramel is ready is crucial for a successful flan. Look for a deep amber color, with a rich, nutty aroma. Be careful not to let it darken too much, as it can quickly turn bitter.</li><li><strong>The Water Bath Method:</strong> One of the secrets to achieving a smooth, creamy texture in flan is using a water bath during baking. This gentle, indirect heat helps prevent the edges from overcooking and ensures even cooking throughout the custard.</li><li><strong>Perfecting the Bake: </strong>When it comes to baking flan, timing is everything. The custard should be set around the edges but still slightly jiggly in the center when gently shaken. Remove it from the oven and allow it to cool completely before refrigerating to set.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Caramel-Flan-6-crop.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to make the Perfect Flan:</h2><li>&nbsp;<strong>Start by caramelizing the sugar.</strong> This is the key step as it is the base for the perfect flan. Add sugar to a heavy-bottomed pan and cook on medium-low heat until the sugar is melted and a golden brown. Lift up the pan and swirl it around to ensure even melting. Get the pan ready so as soon as the sugar is melted, it can be quickly poured into the pan.</li><li><strong>Make the filling by mixing softened cream cheese, evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, sugar, eggs, and vanilla.</strong> This filling can be whipped up in a blender to make sure it is creamy.</li><li><strong>Pour the filling on top of caramelized sugar.</strong>&nbsp; Place the pan on a larger baking sheet or roasting pan. Place in oven and carefully add hot water to reach at least 1-2 inches on the sides.</li><li><strong>Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour.</strong> Carefully remove flan from oven, leaving behind larger pan filled water. Once flan is removed, carefully remove the pan of hot water. Place flan back inside roasting&nbsp;pan, filled with water, to slowly cool for 30 minutes.</li><li><strong>Place flan in the refrigerator to chill for at least two hours, overnight is ideal.&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>When ready to serve, take a knife and run along sides of the pan.</strong>&nbsp; Take a cake plate or serving platter and place it on top of the pan. Flip it over and the flan with release so the caramel is now on the top. The caramel will slowly drip off of the pan so make sure you get all of the caramel.</li><li><strong>Serve with fresh whipped cream and strawberries.&nbsp;</strong></li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Caramel-Flan-6.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Flan Recipe FAQ’s:</h2><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center block-tip__title has-x-large-font-size">Why do I need to use a water bath when making flan?</h2><p class="has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">One of the secrets to achieving a smooth, creamy texture in flan is using a water bath during baking. This gentle, indirect heat of hot water surrounding the pan helps prevent the edges from overcooking and ensures even cooking throughout the custard. It helps to ensure the flan doesn’t curdle or dry out.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center block-tip__title has-x-large-font-size">Do I need to make my flan custard in a blender?</h2><p class="has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">This is such an easy flan recipe because the custard is made in a blender which helps to create the most velvety, smoothest flan. Since there is cream cheese in this flan recipe, the blender makes it smooth and creamy.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center block-tip__title has-x-large-font-size">What are tips for removing flan from the pan?</h2><p class="has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">When you remove the flan from the oven, I suggest running a sharp knife along the edges so that as it cools, it doesn’t stick to the pan. After it chills in the refrigerator, run a knife along the edges one more time to ensure it is loose from the pan before inverting on a plate. When the pan is inverted, you may hit the bottom of the pan to ensure all of the flan is released onto the plate.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><a href=# rel=noopener><span><strong>Click Here to Find all of my Mexican Food Recipes in one Place.&nbsp;</strong></span></a></h3><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Popular Dessert Recipes:</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Best-Flan-Recipe.jpg><p class=block-pinterest-cta__title>Pin this now to find it later</p><a href=# title="Share on Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=wp-element-button data-postid=10935 data-pin-do=none data-social-network=Pinterest data-social-action=Pin data-social-target=https://www.modernhoney.com/caramel-flan/>Pin It</a><h4 class="wprm-recipe-group-name wprm-recipe-ingredient-group-name wprm-block-text-bold">Topping Ideas:</h4><ul class=wprm-recipe-instructions readability=16.5><li id=wprm-recipe-13056-step-0-0 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=-1><p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</p></li><li id=wprm-recipe-13056-step-0-1 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=3><p>In a heavy-bottomed pot, add 1 cup of sugar, and cook on medium-low heat until sugar is completely melted and a deep golden brown.
