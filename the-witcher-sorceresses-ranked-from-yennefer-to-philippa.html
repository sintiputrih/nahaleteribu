Visenna</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Netflix_visenna.jpg><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true>You might find Visenna’s inclusion in this list confusing, as she has neither participated in any prominent events nor influenced the world at large. Of course, that’s barring the obvious, which is giving birth to one Geralt of Rivia, the titular protagonist of the story. Visenna was a druid healer, who took her son Geralt to Kaer Morhen when he was a boy.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>Visenna makes one last appearance in The Sword of Destiny, tending to Geralt’s wounds when he is on the brink of death. The monster hunter recognizes his mother and tries to ask why she left him, but Visenna never gives him the chance. Geralt thinks it might be for the best. Visenna also makes a brief appearance in the live-action adaptation, but we doubt we’ll see her again in the series.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>9. Sabrina Glevissig</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=597 data-current-count=897 data-injectable=true>Netflix introduces Sabrina early on in the first season, so we can only imagine what they plan to do with her character in the show. As far as the books are concerned, though, Sabrina is a relatively minor character, though as deft a manipulator as many of her peers in the Lodge of Sorceresses. During the Thanned Coup, Sabrina is among those who help arrest the Nilfgaardian traitors. Even in Netflix’s The Witcher, the character plays an important part in the attempt to push back the Nilfgaardians at Sodden Hill, which means that there can be no question as to where her true loyalties lie.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>8. Fringilla Vigo</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=711 data-injectable=true>Fringilla was a sorceress in the employ of the Nilfgaardian empire. She fought against Yennefer in the Battle of Sodden Hill, but was later approached by Assire var Anahid, who offered her a seat in the newly established Lodge of Sorceresses. Fringilla was also the second cousin of Anna Henrietta, the Duchess of Toussaint, whom The Witcher fans recognize as a main character from the Blood and Wine DLC.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=512 data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true>When Geralt and his party reached the province, Fringilla seduced the Witcher into her bed, and the two began a romantic entanglement that lasted for the remainder of his stay. Fringilla tried everything in her power to keep the Witcher in Toussaint, and though he developed some feelings for her, his love for Yennefer would not be overcome. Fringilla tried everything in her power to make the Witcher stay, but when Geralt learned Ciri’s whereabouts, the party made for Stygga Castle with all possible haste.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>7. Francesca Findabair</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/francesca-findabair-witcher.jpg><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=697 data-injectable=true>Francesca Findabair is already a prominent character in Netflix’s The Witcher. Called Enid an Gleanna, or Daisy of the Valleys in the Elder Speech, she was an Elven sorceress and the queen of the Dol Blathanna elves. Francesca helped the mages of Thanedd when they attempted to thwart Nilfgaard’s invasion of the Northern Kingdoms, and fought alongside them during the Battle of Sodden Hill.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>Francesca is going to play a huge part in the future of the story, and if the Netflix adaptation remains faithful to the books, the Daisy of the Valleys is also going to save Yennefer’s life on one occasion. Francesca is also a founding member of the Lodge of Sorceresses, which will take up the Brotherhood of Sorcerers’ work after the infamous Thanedd coup, the events of which we’ll see in The Witcher season 3.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>6. Keira Metz</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/keira-metz-the-witcher.jpg><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>Keira Metz was the former advisor to King Foltest of Temeria and played a pivotal role in the events of the Thanned coup. Keira is one of the first to learn about a Nilfgaardian plan to overthrow the Brother of Sorcerers, so she hatches plans of her own with some other fellow sorceresses to prevent it.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>Years later, during the events of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Geralt visits Keira, who is hiding out in the no man’s land of Velen to avoid Radovid’s witch hunt. Keira helps Geralt shed light on Ciri’s time in Velen, and she later joins the effort to fight Eredin’s spectral riders at Kaer Morhen. Based on the player’s choice, Keira and the Witcher Lambert might end up developing a romantic bond. The sorceress is also present when the party, joined by Emhyr’s legions, fights off the Wild Hunt one last time in Skellige.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>5. Phillipa Eilhart</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>In terms of political maneuvering, no mage in the Witcher world can compete with Phillipa Eilhart. She was the sorceress who led the Northern resistance against the Thanned coup, causing a cataclysmic battle on the island. Even before the fateful events of that day, Phillipa helped Geralt and Jaskier (Dandelion) locate Rience, who was hunting Ciri at the time.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>Eilhart is deeply embedded with the Redanian spymaster Dijkstra’s plans, though the ends they pursue might differ from one another. The two are romantically involved, and can be seen hatching political plans numerous times during the course of the story. Phillipa is a major character in The Witcher game trilogy, and while she may come off as a manipulator looking out for no one but herself and her political agendas, she ends up helping Geralt, especially when it involves Ciri, more than once.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>4. Lara Dorren</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>We’d be remiss to not bring up Lara Dorren when talking about the most powerful and consequential mages in the history of the Continent. She was Ciri’s ancestor after all, and the person whose actions changed the course of history forever.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>Lara was an Elven mage who carried Hen Ichaer, or the Elder Blood, giving her powers and abilities that confound even the wisest of the Aen Elle or Aen Seidhe. She herself was an Aen Elle princess who fell in love with a human sorcerer called Cregennan of Lod. Both races found this union abhorrent, so they persecuted Lara and her kin.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=832 data-injectable=true>In the end, Lara was driven off by humans, and a man-in-arms chopped off her fingers when she was coming out of the royal carriage. Lara was pregnant at the time, and she died on a hilltop amidst a raging blizzard giving birth to a half-elven girl called Riannon. When the sun shone in the east the day after, the hilltop was carpeted with flowers and blossoms despite the torrent that laid waste to it the night before. That place was hence known as Dol Blathanna or the Valley of Flowers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>3. Triss Merigold</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=564 data-current-count=864 data-injectable=true>Triss Merigold is one of the main protagonists in The Witcher series by Andrzej Sapkowski, and due to her legendary deeds, she has gone down in history as Merigold the Fearless. When she began her journey as a mage, Triss served Temeria but ultimately found herself in the company of Geralt. Knowing about the Witcher’s relationship with her friend Yennefer, Triss used magic on Geralt to seduce him into her bed, and the two entered a brief relationship. It was here when Triss fell head over heels in love with the Witcher, a feeling that was not reciprocated.</p><p data-characters=539 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true>Triss was also present during the Battle of Sodden Hill, which is why she earned the alias of the Fourteenth on the Hill, erroneously thought to have been killed by the Nilfgaardians. At Geralt’s behest, Triss makes her way to Kaer Morhen to help Ciri, who is showing a peculiar aptitude for Chaos magic. Triss also helps Ciri learn about her womanly traits, and the two develop a close bond. Triss accompanies Geralt’s party throughout Blood of Elves and plays a major role in the Thanedd coup, even ending up saving Geralt’s life.</p><p data-characters=629 data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true>After the destruction of Aretuza, Triss lays low and follows events from behind the curtains. Make no mistake, however, as Triss is one of the most powerful sorceresses to ever live. This becomes apparent when she finally unleashes her full strength during the Rivian Pogrom, raining fire on the mobs and devastating their ranks, which gives Yennefer the opportunity to make her way through to Geralt, who is fighting for his life on the other side. Triss also accompanies Geralt for the majority of The Witcher game trilogy, not only helping him hunt down Letho of Gulet in Assassins of Kings but also finding Ciri in Wild Hunt.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>2. Yennefer of Vengerberg</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Yennefer-of-Vengerberg-The-Witcher-Anya-Chalotra.jpg><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=748 data-injectable=true>Yennefer is a human mage of great power and the foster mother of Ciri. It is when she first meets Geralt of Rivia that the once-hunchback sorceress gets swept into an adventure unlike any other. During their first encounter, Geralt uses his last wish to bind his and Yennefer’s fates together, thus saving her from the djinn’s wrath. Geralt and Yennefer then begin a relationship, which falls apart due to the incompatible lifestyles they lead.</p><p data-characters=512 data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true>Ciri is the key that brings them together, and Yennefer spends a great deal of time with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Child Surprise</a>, which then grows into a full-blown maternal love. Much like Geralt, Yennefer spends the majority of the story trying to find and protect Ciri. Yennefer is also a protagonist in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and if the events of that game — which take place many years after the books — are anything to go by, she and the Witcher can get their happy ending together if the player makes the right choices.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>1. Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ciri-season-3-witcher.jpg><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=769 data-injectable=true>Ciri may not have the extensive education offered to sorcerers at Aretuza to help her out of tough situations, but due to being Lara Dorren’s descendant, she’s arguably the most powerful mage in the world, perhaps even in history. Ciri has the ability to travel through time and space at will. She can even traverse alternate realities that comprise Andrzej Sapkowski’s multiverse, and we’ve been led to believe that one of these worlds is actually our own.</p><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=false>The Cintran princess also underwent extensive Witcher training at Kaer Morhen, and furthered the study of the sword during her time with the Rats. Almost every noble, magic, or person of interest or power in the Continent tries to get their hands on Ciri at one point or another in the saga, and since we spend the majority of the later books in her POV, some fans even go so far as to suggest that it is Ciri, not Geralt, who is the main character of this story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmrqKsk52ys3nSqKmcnaKawLSx0mapmqabmrFustGopGaxlaO7prLEq2Stp12ltaq4yKmnmmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
