In Harry Potter’s year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, she was a witch. She was born into the Parkinson’s family and was a member of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. She was put into Slytherin House and achieved perfection in her fifth year.</p><p></p><p>Pansy subsequently joined the short-lived Inquisitorial Squad. On May 2, 1998, during the last battle of the Second Wizarding War at Hogwarts, she argued in support of handing over Harry Potter to Lord Voldemort. In Harry’s defense, most of her classmates waved their wands at her. Pansy is thought to have survived the Great Wizarding War after leaving the Great Hall with the other Slytherins before the Battle of Hogwarts and did not return to battle. She had a falling out with her erstwhile buddy Draco Malfoy sometime after the war. Katherine Nicholson played a role in the Philosopher’s Stone and Chamber of Secrets, Genevieve Gaunt in Prisoner of Azkaban, Charlotte Richie in Goblet of Fire, and Lauren Shotton in Order of the Phoenix.</p><h2>A look Into Cooper Hefner and Scarlett Byrne’s dating history</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Cooper-Hefner-2.jpg alt=" Cooper Hefner" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Cooper Hefner and Scarlett Byrne tied the knot in August of 2015.
