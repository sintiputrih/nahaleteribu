In 1923 <strong>Lise Meitner</strong> worked on the radiationless transition, later called the Auger effect and named after the French scientist <strong>Pierre Auger</strong> who discovered the fact in 1925.</p><p>Due to political upheaval in <strong>Europe</strong> in the late 1930s, <strong>Meitner</strong> moved to Sweden where she continued her research at <strong>Manne Siegbahn Institute</strong>. She kept a low profile and was also subject to some hostility because of her gender. Because of this, she worked quietly with <strong>Hahn</strong> on research and experiments relating to nuclear fission, keeping a low profile.</p><p>In January 1939 the experiments proving evidence relating to nuclear fission were made public. Then in February 1939, <strong>Meitner</strong> provided the physical explanation for the observations. She also came up with the term atomic fission.</p><p><strong>Hahn</strong> won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1944 for his research into fission, but Meitner’s role was mostly unacknowledged. In 1966 <strong>Meitner</strong> was belatedly recognized when the Enrico Fermi Award was given to Meitner, Strassmann, and Hahn.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><h2>Later Life</h2><p><strong>Lise Meitner</strong> spent her later years in Cambridge, England.
