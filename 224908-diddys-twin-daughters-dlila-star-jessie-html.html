In November 2018, their mother, <a class="me a" href=#>Kim Porter</a>, passed away.

Tributes came pouring in from celebrities and people from all walks of life.</p><p class=dh>The family was obviously in the public eye, and Diddy did everything he could to make sure that the children didn't <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://people.com/parents/diddy-protected-kids-from-kim-porter-death-news/>find out</a> about Kim's death from the news. Diddy sent people out to gather the children so that they wouldn't have to learn about their mother's death from social media.</p><p class=dh>Since her passing, Diddy says that he is a lot more involved with the family because that is something Kim would've wanted. Though the family is doing well now, this grief has and will continue to affect them.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.biography.com/musician/sean-puffy-combs>Diddy</a> and Kim met while she was working part-time at Uptown Records, and Diddy thought that she was the "one." When they began dating, Kim was a single mother and insisted that her son, Quincy Brown, was part of the deal. This deal is something that Diddy still honors to this day.</p><p class=dh>Years later, they welcomed their son, Christian, and after that, the twins, D'Lila Star and Jessie. The couple's relationship did not exactly go down a smooth road and it was an on and off union.</p><p class=dh>Kim and Diddy only dated from 1994 to 2007. Just weeks before the twins, D'Lila Star and Jessie were born, Diddy's daughter, Chance Combs was born. This caused some pain in their relationship.</p><p class=dh>The strong woman took it all in stride and celebrated their family as is. Her last Instagram posts celebrated the family as a whole, including Diddy's eldest son, Justin, from a previous relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/681077c954acc874aed92f7bc0db20e7.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Sean Combs and his children arrive at the Los Angeles Premiere Of "Can't Stop Won't Stop" at Writers Guild of America, West in Los Angeles, California on June 21, 2017 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Kim's untimely passing has had the effect of bringing the family closer together.
