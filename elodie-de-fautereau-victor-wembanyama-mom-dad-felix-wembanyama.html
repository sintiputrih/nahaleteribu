He has made his mom and dad proud.</p><p>He represents Metropolitans 92 of the LNB Pro A as a professional basketball player from France. He enrolled in the Nanterre 92 LBA Pro A basketball team’s youth development program when he was ten years old, and in 2019, following several loan stints, he made his professional debut for them. He is predicted by many to be selected first overall in the 2023 NBA draft.</p><p>As of now, he is one of the most famous prospects and will be selected by an NBA team in the 2023 draft. The media even referred to Wembanyama as the only most excellent prospect in the history of the NBA. Wembanyama has strong ball-handling abilities, is a solid shooter, can make three-pointers, and creates terrific shots.</p><p>He is renowned for his shot-blocking instincts when playing defense. His main strength, which offers him an advantage in the game, is height. His lean body may provide challenges, but as the greats have repeated time and time, there should always be room for improvement to achieve further greatness in life.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Victor Wembanyama’s Quick Facts">Victor Wembanyama’s Quick Facts</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Meet Elodie de Fautereau & Felix Wembanyama, Victor Wembanyama’s Parents">Meet Elodie de Fautereau & Felix Wembanyama, Victor Wembanyama’s Parents</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Who Are Victor Wembanyama’s Siblings?">Who Are Victor Wembanyama’s Siblings?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4" href=# title="Victor Wembanyama’s Career So Far">Victor Wembanyama’s Career So Far</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5" href=# title="Some FAQs">Some FAQs</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6" href=# title="Who Are Victor Wembanyama’s Parents?">Who Are Victor Wembanyama’s Parents?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-7" href=# title="Does Victor Wembanyama Have Siblings?">Does Victor Wembanyama Have Siblings?</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=victor-wembanyamas-quick-facts></span>Victor Wembanyama’s Quick Facts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Professional Basketball Player</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Current Team</strong></td><td>Metropolitans 92</td></tr><tr><td><strong>DOB</strong></td><td>4 January 2004</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birthplace</strong></td><td>Le Chesnay, France</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Parents</strong></td><td>Meet Elodie de Fautereau & Felix Wembanyama</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td>Eve Wembanyama & Oscar Wembanyama</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=meet-elodie-de-fautereau-felix-wembanyama-victor-wembanyamas-parents></span>Meet Elodie de Fautereau & Felix Wembanyama, Victor Wembanyama’s Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Victor was born on January 4, 2004, in Le Chesnay, France, to his parents, Elodie de Fautereau & Felix Wembanyama as a second child.</p><p>His parents raised him in an athletic environment, eventually directing him toward this line of sports. His initial introduction to the sports world was soccer, as he grew up playing the game and also was an excellent player in the local tournaments. He didn’t excel only in basketball but also was an outstanding goalkeeper in soccer.</p><p>Athletism runs in the blood of the Wembanyama family. Father also competed in various sporting events during his prime representing France in international tournaments. Felix Wembanyama is French-born with Congolese ancestry. He used to compete in high jumps and long jumps for track and field.</p><p>Victor’s parents, especially his father, urged him to concentrate on track before basketball because he wanted to see his son compete on a vast platform and carry the family legacy forward. However, he gravitated toward basketball as his main interest in sports, and his choice has worked out perfectly. The level of success he is currently at in basketball would be tough to surpass in any other sport, although he may have also thrived in the athletic area.</p><p>Since he was four or five years old, his mother, a former player, has taught Wembanyama the basics of basketball. She is a very athletic woman who stands 6 feet 3 inches tall. He has inherited these qualities from his parents, which have undoubtedly assisted him in his game.</p><p>The administration of significant teams in Spain began to hear about his brilliance. He started his professional career with Entente Le Chesnay Versailles, a local club, before enrolling in Nanterre 92’s youth program when he was eleven. But his parents declined offers from more illustrious organizations like ASVEL and FC Barcelona. Wembanyama led his squad to third place in the Minicopa del Rey, an event for young athletes under 14, while on loan to FC Barcelona in February 2018.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-are-victor-wembanyamas-siblings></span>Who Are Victor Wembanyama’s Siblings?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Victor is the second child of his parents, so he has an elder sister and a younger brother as siblings.</p><p>They all grew together in Le Chesney, France, which they call home. All kids of the Wembanyama family are active in basketball and pushing their family name to prestigious heights, setting an example for the much younger generations.</p><p>Eve Wembanyama, Victor’s older sister, is a basketball player who is presently a small forward for the French LDLC team ASVEL Feminine. She was a member of the French squad that won the gold medal in the FIBA U16 Women’s European Championship and is 6 feet tall. Like her brother, she is also considered one of the excellent women’s talents in the France basketball scene.</p><p>Recently, she equaled a career-best on January 29, 2022, in a France – LF2 matchup. She contributed 13 points on that particular day in Calais’s 73-66 road loss to Aulnoye. She also had two steals and six rebounds. She shot 44.4% overall and 2/7 from two and two from three. She also made 3/4 of her free throw attempts.</p><p>Oscar Wembanyama, Victor’s younger brother, is making waves in the French basketball scene. Recently, the 15-year-old signed with ASVEL’s U18 squad. With this chance, the youthful Wembanyama, who has already distinguished himself with a few outstanding shots on the side of the U15 Elite of Nanterre, will have plenty of time to develop his basketball. Victor’s brother is now waiting for the next level, and if he has the skills, maybe even a spot on the squad of the French champions in a few years.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=victor-wembanyamas-career-so-far></span>Victor Wembanyama’s Career So Far<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Victor is at the very early stage of his career, and still, he is considered one of such players who can be seen once in every generation.</p><p>Every NBA club will be battling for his contract on the following year’s draft night due to his high talent on the field. His inclusion in the NBA draft the next year would create a sense of rivalry among clubs before the start of the regular 2023 NBA season. He provided a preview of his recent American performance earlier this month.</p><p>The teenager has been a professional athlete since he was 16 years old. In recent weeks, his fame has skyrocketed as he competed for the NBA G-Ignite, League, where he went up against Scoot Henderson, another high draft prospect. Because of the presence of such a superstar in the draft next year, there will be a superstar prospect with buzz comparable to that of LeBron James.</p><p>Victor’s confidence has received a much-needed pump after he is compared with one of the game’s legends. In a recent interview, Lebron also praised him, saying he was alien while other contenders of the NBA draft in the current were unicorns. Like James, many different reputed eyes of the game will be significantly interested in next year’s NBA draft, and the contest will be interesting for fans and spectators.</p><p>He enrolled in the Nanterre 92 LBA Pro A basketball team’s youth development program when he was ten years old, and in 2019, following several loan stints, he made his professional debut for them. Wembanyama was selected as the 2020–21 Pro A Best Young Player. After that season, he agreed to a three-year deal with ASVEL of the Pro A and the EuroLeague.</p><p>Victor Wembanyama was awarded LNB Pro A’s Best Young Player for the second consecutive season after the 2021–22 campaign. He has committed to a two-year deal with Metropolitans 92 of the Pro A on June 30, 2022.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=some-faqs></span>Some FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-are-victor-wembanyamas-parents></span>Who Are Victor Wembanyama’s Parents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Elodie de Fautereau & Felix Wembanyama are the proud parents of Victor Wembanyama.
