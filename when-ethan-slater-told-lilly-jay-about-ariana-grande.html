Us Weekly reports that Slater told Jay about Grande (and explained that he wanted to split up) just days before the public learned about their relationship. As a source put it, “Ethan sat Lilly down a few days before the news broke about him and Ariana and said that he wanted a divorce."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And another source stressed this point again to Us Weekly, saying they “were separated when they started dating and the relationship is recent. It’s understandable that it’s difficult to see an ex move on, especially in such a public way, and they are trying to be as respectful as possible.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So yeah, a lot of conflicting info!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Anyway, this source also notes that “Ariana and Ethan weren’t careful.

Meanwhile, Slater was gushing over Jay as recently as May, when he wrote on Instagram: “Happy first Mother’s Day, to the most loving caring and wonderful mom/person in the world, from me and this little guy.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As of now neither Slater nor Grande have said anything about their relationship status, but again: The Wicked press tour should be … interesting!</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/281ca4da-3e06-4994-8c0d-6abe79956de7_1539814210.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Mehera Bonner" title="Headshot of Mehera Bonner" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Mehera Bonner is a celebrity and entertainment news writer who enjoys Bravo and Antiques Roadshow with equal enthusiasm, She was previously entertainment editor at Marie Claire and has covered pop culture for over a decade.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6GutbHSrWaabGRrgnF9lmxmsKCVo3qmwMeapWarnJbBpr6MraalnF2htq242GahmrFdlq%2BwwdNmmKuhkaOubrPRmqWdnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
