He became famous after this role, although his star was rising after films like&nbsp;Romeo + Juliet and&nbsp;What's Eating GilbertGrape.&nbsp;He also&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">became friendly with director James Cameron</a>&nbsp;after Titanic&nbsp;and&nbsp;the two talk about environmental topics.</p><p>While Leo was wonderful as Jack, another A-List star could have played this part, and that was Matthew McConaughey.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Matthew-McConaughey-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McConaughey and Kate Winslet auditioned for&nbsp;Titanic</a>, according to&nbsp;Today.com.</p><p>The actor said, "I went and auditioned. I wanted that. I auditioned with Kate Winslet. Had a good audition. Walked away from there pretty confident that I had it. I didn’t get it. I never got offered that."</p><p>He has a sense of humor about not getting the part: he explained. "As I've said before, not even half-jokingly if it’s true, if that was an offer and it didn’t come to me, I've got to go back and go, 'I've got to meet in an alley with that agent.'"</p><p>While known for many comedies,&nbsp;McConaughey can also do drama, and won praise for performances in&nbsp;The Dallas Buyers Club,&nbsp;Mud, and the TV series&nbsp;True Detective. It's easy to see that he would have been amazing as Jack in&nbsp;Titanic, too.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s What Happened In This Mexican Town After ‘Titanic’ Was Filmed There</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=casting-leo-and-rose>Casting Leo And Rose</h2><p>James Cameron shared on&nbsp;The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">women loved Leonardo DiCaprio</a>&nbsp;and that was why he cast him as Jack. According to&nbsp;Cinemablend, Cameron explained, "Matthew read for the part and then we met Leo. Leo came in for an interview and I had this weird thing: I looked around the room and every woman in the building was in the meeting… the accountant was there, the female security guard, so I thought maybe I better cast this guy."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kate-Winslet-In-Titanic.jpg><p>What about Kate Winslet? According to&nbsp;Biography.com, she was interviewed by&nbsp;RollingStone,&nbsp;she cried a lot while reading the screenplay and just felt that it was a great project for her. She said, "Right, I’ve absolutely got to be a part of this. No two ways about it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Winslet was very determined to get cast in&nbsp;Titanic&nbsp;and even got James Cameron's number from her agent and called him. He was&nbsp;driving on the highway and that didn't stop her, as she told him that she really needed to play a role in this movie.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Entertainment Weekly, Winslet did two camera tests and was hired.</p><p>It worked out well as Winslet and DiCaprio not only played Rose and Jack perfectly and have been so loved since, but they became pals in the process.&nbsp;In 2016, Winslet talked to&nbsp;People&nbsp;and called DiCaprio "a great friend."&nbsp;In an interview with&nbsp;Glamour UK, the actress mentioned that the two stars really do talk about the movie that brought them both a lot of recognition and praise. She said, "we’re very, very close and sometimes we do quote the odd Titanic line back and forth to each another, because only we can, and we find it really funny.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Did Leonardo DiCaprio Earn From His Role In ’Titanic’?</a></span></p><h2 id=celebrating-20-years>Celebrating 20 Years</h2><p>It's not surprising to hear that when Kate Winslet read the screenplay for&nbsp;Titanic, she cried, as it's impossible to watch&nbsp;Titanic&nbsp;and not cry (or sob). Many people remember watching this movie for the first time and being overcome with so much sadness and other emotions.</p><p>The movie turned 20 years old in 2017, and according to&nbsp;Entertainment Weekly,&nbsp;there was actually some public outcry before the movie hit theatres. Winslet said she is "still baffled" and it's easy to understand why she feels that way, as the movie did so well and is still so beloved to this day.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Which ‘Star Wars’ Character Did Leonardo DiCaprio Almost Play?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Any fan of&nbsp;Titanic&nbsp;is going to want to re-watch the movie after hearing that another actor could have played Jack (while prepared to cry a lot, of course). And this is even sweeter: in 2004, Leonardo DiCaprio was interviewed on the&nbsp;Oprah Winfrey Show&nbsp;and said that Kate&nbsp;Winslet was his "favorite" person to kiss in a movie. He said, "I’m just going to go with Kate Winslet, good old classic" and spoke of her very fondly.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Close Are Leonardo DiCaprio And Johnny Depp Now?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaGTnXqiecuiqq1lo6mus3nDoptmo5Gpsm7DyKeqpZ2kYq62sMitoKimXay2tbSMn6arZaSewaK6yJxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
