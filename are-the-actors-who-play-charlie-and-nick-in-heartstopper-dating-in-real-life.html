And I get it, everyone loves a good on-screen pairing that transitions to a real-life couple. Some great celebrity relationships have started that way, and many more are sure to come. Perhaps for that reason — and their chemistry on screen, of course — fans have been wondering about the nature of <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kit Connor</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Locke</a></strong>‘s relationship.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=502 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=true>As most Heartstopper enthusiasts surely know by now, both actors are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">part of the LGBTQ+ community</a>, much like some of their fellow cast members. That fact, in addition to their good relationship and apparent closeness, has led many to believe that Connor and Locke are an item. Of course, the TikTok that Locke recently uploaded, where he shows off a hoodie with Connor’s face on it and claims to have a celebrity crush (with a bunch of heart emojis in the mix), has further increased speculation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.tiktok.com/@joelocke03/video/7263177872251178273</figure><h2 id=h-are-kit-connor-and-joe-locke-dating data-injectable=false>Are Kit Connor and Joe Locke dating?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kit-Connor-and-Joe-Locke-as-Nick-and-Charlie-in-Heartstopper-Netflix-1.jpg><p data-characters=539 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true>Can a TikTok be used as proof that there is something going on between the two? Well, it certainly doesn’t help in squelching the rumors, but it also can’t be taken as evidence. Despite the ever-present rumors surrounding the co-stars, there has never been a confirmation that the two are in a relationship, but they seem to be very good friends. And being friends with someone also means showing affection for them. In fact, the duo has only ever addressed each other as such, so there really isn’t much else to be said.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>A while back, Connor was rumored to be dating actress Maia Reffico after being seen holding hands with her, but the assumptions and accusations only led the actor to feel <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pressured to out himself</a>. Understandably, he is now keeping his love life private, having opted not to reveal whether or not he is dating someone in a recent interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a>.</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=752 data-injectable=false>As for Locke, he has also not announced any romantic partners recently, meaning that as far as the public is aware, Joe Locke and Kit Connor are not dating in real life. Sad news for fans of the two, I know, but at the end of the day, what matters is that they’re both happy. If they ever choose to make their romantic lives public knowledge, fans will undoubtedly be here to support them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2Sus7GMrZ%2BeZZGYwbC%2B0mauoaddpbmixYycn5qqnJ6ybq3NnWSnoZOgeqq6jKGcmqqkqMGwvM%2BeqWackam2r7OMoqVmqpWWuW64yJ%2BcaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
