His height is average, standing at 5 feet 7 inches (1.70m, 170cm). His medium build body has a weight of 73kg (161Ibs).</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=His_Facial_Expression></span><strong>His Facial Expression</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Looking at the various images of Zelensky from social media to mainstream media, there is no doubt that he is someone who always smiles. In fact, he has every reason to smile considering his earlier career as a TV personality and comedian. Comedians make people laugh even when they don’t want to, so if you make people laugh and smile, it won’t be a bad idea to always wear that look on your face.</p><p>However, with the recent invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022, Zelensky seems to be wearing his toughest look ever,</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Does_He_Dress></span><strong>How Does He Dress?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As President of Ukraine, Zelensky dresses the way it fits the office and personality of a president of a typical European country- the suit and tie. Whenever he is away from official functions, he dresses casually.</p><p>Recently, his official way of dressing has changed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He now dresses to fit the occasion. By occasion, we mean militarily.</p><p>Ever since the war, he has been spotted in a military vest and camouflage.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Vladimir_Putins_Height_Facial_Expression_and_Fashion_Sense></span><strong>Vladimir Putin’s Height, Facial Expression and Fashion Sense</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/jukebugs.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Vladimir-Putin-4.jpg><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth:&nbsp;</strong>7th October 1952</li><li><strong>Age: </strong>71 years old</li><li><strong>Place of Birth:&nbsp;</strong>Saint Petersburg, Russia</li><li><strong>Height:&nbsp;</strong>5 feet 7 inches (1.70m)</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Tall_is_He></span><strong>How Tall is He?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The Russian President Putin is of average height. He stands at 5 feet 7 inches (1.70m, 170cm) tall and has a body weight of 83kg (182lbs). Equally, he has 18% body fat,&nbsp;4.7 muscle index, 20 inches shoulder span, and 14 inches waist span.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Putins_Demeanor_is_Stern></span><strong>Putin’s Demeanor is Stern</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On several occasions, Putin’s face shows a man that is unyielding and uncompromising. The Western media portrays him to the world as someone whose face looks so serious.</p><p>While this may remain a topic for debit, going through a good number of pictures and clips of some of his appearances at national and international engagements, we found out the claims not to be true entirely. There are instances where he smiles, laughs, and frowns. So, it is safe to say his demeanor is determined by moods, moments, and occasions.</p><p>To have this look, there are speculations that he hires the services of a dedicated aesthetic surgeon and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Boxtox injections</a>. Similarly, the injections are said to have the ability to slow how one feels emotions. However, these claims have not been verified yet.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=He_Built_An_Image_From_From_His_Clothes></span><strong>He Built An Image From From His Clothes</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The Russian President is a man of high taste. He is careful about what he buys and puts in his wardrobe from shoes, clothes to accessories. In some quarters he is seen as a man who built an alpha male image through what he wears.</p><p>Over the years, Putin has shown his political dexterity and superiority through his high fashion taste. He prefers to cover his somewhat athletic body with customized power suits in classic cuts, dark colors, and fine fabrics from the popular Italian designer Brioni.</p><p>Some times in 2014, his collection of wristwatches was estimated to be around 22 million rubles ($682, 000, as of then). What is fascinating about this revelation is the fact that the said amount is nearly six times his 3.6 million rubles ($110, 000) annual salary.</p><p><strong>Also See-<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rimma Zelenskaya Is Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s Mother: All We Know About Her</a></strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Adolf_Hitlers_Height_Facial_Expression_and_Fashion_Sense></span><strong>Adolf Hitler’s Height, Facial Expression and Fashion Sense</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/jukebugs.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Adolf-Hitler.jpg><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth:&nbsp;</strong>20th April 1889</li><li><strong>Place of Birth:&nbsp;</strong>Braunau am Inn, Austria</li><li><strong>Died:&nbsp;</strong>30th April 1945</li><li><strong>Height:&nbsp;</strong>5 feet 9 inches (1.75m)</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=There_Was_A_5_Inches_Drop_in_His_Height_When_The_Autopsy_of_His_Remains_Was_Released_in_The_1980s></span><strong>There Was A 5 Inches Drop in His Height When The Autopsy of His Remains Was Released in The 1980s</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The late German dictator’s height is average, standing at 5 feet 9 inches (1.75m, 175cm) tall, according to his WW1 records. However, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Soviet autopsy report</a> released in the 1908s describes his remains as 5 feet 4 inches (1.65m, 165cm) tall.</p><p>Looking at his WW1 height record and the autopsy reports, Hitler’s height dropped by 5 inches. Therefore, it means that he was taller as a young person than he was when he was older.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Thousands_of_Images_Portrays_Hitlers_Demeanor></span><strong>Thousands of Images Portrays Hitler’s Demeanor</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>When Hitler was alive, he was intentional and calculative with his poses for photographs. Heinrich Hoffmann, the man who was responsible for about 10,000 pictures of the German dictator reveals in an interview that Hitler doesn’t allow any photographer to him what to do. For him, pictures are the best ways he communicated with the world and the people he ruled over in his time.</p><p>Interestingly, these images capture his temper, unpredictable and almost violent gestures. Also, these emotions have all been expressed through his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">face or body language</a></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Clothes_Make_Him_Feel_Superior></span><strong>Clothes Make Him Feel Superior</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Hitler sees what he wears as a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">kind of armor</a> that makes him unbeatable. There are various scenarios the German dictator uses to show his superiority through his clothes. For instance, he dressed in a field-grey uniform when he was invading Poland on 1st September 1939, and continues to use it till the war ended.</p><p>When placed side by side with other men of timber and caliber of his time, Hitler stood out.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Verdict></span><strong>The Verdict</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following this thorough analysis of Zelensky, Putin, and Hitler’s height, we discover that the Ukrainian President shares the same height as the Russian President, except Hitler. Zelensky and Putin are 5 feet 7 inches (1.70m) tall, while Hitler’s WWI records reveal he was 5 feet 9 inches (1.75m) tall. But, a Soviet autopsy report show that Hitler’s remains was 5 feet 4 inches (1.65m). Therefore, if we are to go by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American standard height measurement</a> for males, Zelensky, Putin and Hitler are average.</p><p>Although Zelensky and Putin are of the same height, their bodyweight varies. The Ukrainian President weighs 161 pounds while the Russian President is 182 pounds.</p><p>Despite the slight differences in their facial expressions, weight, and manner of dressing, the three seem to share two things thing in common, Europe and power. Therefore, the way they dress and express their emotions speaks loudly about their personality as leaders of their countries.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiipaCyo8HGrGWcp51kw7C4zp2wprGiYsemuMSnqqSxXZ2yqrPHrWScp52lrrOxw2arqGWmoa6ltcyiqWaopam2r3nAp5tmmZSkuad5x6KrpZ2iZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
