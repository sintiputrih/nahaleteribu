Introduced in the second episode of season 12, Derrick Gibson is Chicago Fire’s newest recruit, so what do we know about the character so far?</p><h2 id=h-who-is-gibson-on-chicago-fire data-injectable=false>Who is Gibson on ‘Chicago Fire?’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>Derrick Gibson (portrayed by actor Rome Flynn) made his debut on episode two of Chicago Fire’s most recent season, titled “Call Me McHolland”. He was added to Firehouse 51’s roster after making a heroic act while responding to a fire at a bike store. Gibson’s bravery in saving a Firehouse 51 member caught the attention of leading officer Stella Kidd, who recommended that he be added to her engine.</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>Gibson is reportedly a former amateur boxer with a dark past, and his history and origins are set to be explored throughout his run on Chicago Fire. According to showrunner Andrea Newman, Gibson will enjoy a friendship with Kidd, but his newbie status will cause trouble “with a capital T,” for the remaining characters. Viewers will have to wait and see how this storyline unfolds.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true><a title=@romeflynn href=#>@romeflynn</a><p>help on the way , im coming to <a title=chicagofire href=#>#chicagofire</a> jan 24th 👨🏾‍🚒🥵</p><a title="♬ original sound - ✞" href=#>♬ original sound – ✞</a></figure><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>Derrick Gibson was originally written with the name Jake, but was later changed in tribute to Chicago Fire’s creator, Derek Haas, who Newman described as “a vital member” of the show’s family.
