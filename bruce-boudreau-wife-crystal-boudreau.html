Her journey from a delicious drop biscuit to her dessert catering business has really helped her hone her baking skills. As of 2017, the pastry chef had a new role at Sur La Table. There, she taught classes for all skill levels.</p><p>Apart from her own pastry business, Crystal also works alongside her husband. The couple formed Minnesota Blue Ox along with their partners.
