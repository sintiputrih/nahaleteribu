And this time, too, they took the stage by storm with their performance.</p><p>They delivered a combination of singing, rapping and choreographed movements that were energetic and inspiring. And the chorus of the song was laced with the kind of uplifting message that has become a trademark of DYC. The judges were quite impressed with their powerful performance and Heidi Klum even praised their dance routine. "This is by far the best youth choir I have ever seen. I had the biggest smile on my face. It's not just your singing but also your dance routine, it's top-notch."</p><p>Howie Mandel thought the performance was really good and said, "First of all you deliver and just when you think you have seen everything, your solos come up." Simon Cowell also agreed with Heidi and said, "I was thinking where the pinnacle of entertainment was, and its Super Bowl. They should be booked to play in the Super Bowl."</p><h2 class=split>Choir is not 'real talent'</h2><p>While the Detroit Youth Choir's performance impressed the judges, the 'AGT' fans were not so moved. They didn't think "choir is real talent." Viewers took to Twitter to express their opinions. One fan said, "This has to be the last time we’re gonna see them right? #AGT #AGTAllStars." Another one tweeted, "The problem that I have with Detroit Youth Choir is they are too much school assemblies and not Vegas quality. I would have buzzed them multiple times! #AGTAllStars." One more said, "Just came home. Guess I didn't miss much cause DYC was first. #AGT #AGTAllStars."</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>The problem that I have with Detroit Youth Choir is they are too much school assemblies and not Vegas quality.
