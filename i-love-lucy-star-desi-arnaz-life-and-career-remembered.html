For instance, when it comes to <a href=#>I Love Lucy</a>, and especially husband-and-wife stars&nbsp;<a href=#>Desi Arnaz</a> and <a href=#>Lucille Ball</a>, there is simply so much that went on before, during and after the show. Particularly in the case of Desi, an incredibly interesting, often tumultuous life that somehow gets lost to pop culture history.</p><p>“If I were to write the story of Desi Arnaz’ life, I would title it The Prince of Cuba,” muses singer/stand-up comedian/pop culture historian/author <strong>Geoffrey Mark</strong>, whose tomes include <a href=#>The Lucy Book: A Complete Guide to Her Five Decades on Television</a> and <a href=#>Ella: A Biography of the Legendary Ella Fitzgerald</a>. “Most people don’t know this, but Desi was born into incredibly good circumstances. His grandfather went up San Juan Hill with Teddy Roosevelt and was high in Cuban politics. His maternal grandfather was one of the co-founders of the Bacardi rum industry. His father was the first mayor of their town — Santiago de Cuba is where he was born. His uncle was the chief of police of the town, and then his father went into larger politics on the island of Cuba.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/desi-arnaz-too-many-girls-1.jpg><p>“Havana,” he continues, “was the political center of Cuba back then, and Santiago de Cuba was the cultural center of the island. It’s where the music came from and all the arts centered there, not that there weren’t night clubs and things in Havana for the tourists. But on the island, if you were creative, if you were an artist, a musician, a singer, a painter, a writer, you probably spent more time in Santiago.”</p><p>As he explains it, Desi’s family had mansions, ranches, yachts, livestock, and sports cars. “He was,” observes Geoffrey, “born into plenty.”</p><p><strong>For much more on Desi Arnaz, please scroll down.</strong></p><p>Be sure to check out and <a href=#>subscribe to our Classic TV & Film Podcast</a> for interviews with your favorite stars!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46iZKWnppp6rcHCsmSsrJGneqWx0qJkmqqelsduuMifnGaZnpl6pK3RnpyrZaKauqa5wZ6pnpxf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
