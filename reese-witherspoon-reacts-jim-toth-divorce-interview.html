I feel very connected.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/reese-witherspoon-Harpers-BAZAAR-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>The mom of three, 47, and Jim, 52, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced their split</a> in a since-deleted joint social media statement back in March, with Reese subsequently filing in Nashville days later. “It is with a great deal of care and consideration that we have made the difficult decision to divorce,” they wrote in the shared statement. “We have enjoyed so many wonderful years together and are moving forward with deep love, kindness and mutual respect for everything we have created together.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The power couple married in 2011 and welcomed son <strong>Tennessee</strong> in September of 2012. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Reese also shares</a> daughter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ava</strong></a> and son <strong>Deacon</strong> with ex-husband <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ryan Phillippe, </strong></a>whom she divorced in 2008 after nearly 10 years of marriage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BrZqudlaiybsPIrZ%2BeqqOlvLC6jKucmpukqHqrtcxmq6ismGKxqsLOq5qeZZmjwaa%2B1aKcsGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
