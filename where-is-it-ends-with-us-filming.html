In Boston she meets neurosurgeon and love interest, Ryle Kincaid (played by Baldoni). Things get complicated when a figure from Lily’s past is brought into the equation.

Filming for the project actually kicked off last week in Hoboken, NJ. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jersey Digs</a>, several blocks of Bloomfield Street were cordoned off and filled with crews working on the project. There are further shoots planned in the area with two weeks of filming planned in Hackensack, followed by production moving out to shoot in locations across Morris County. It seems the majority of filming will take place in various parts of NJ.</p><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>As stated above, the events in the book actually don’t take place in New Jersey, but rather Boston, Massachusetts. It’s unclear right now whether the location will be changed for the film or if NJ will be presented as if it is Boston; as long as they get some establishing shots of some landmarks the filming could take place pretty much anywhere and no one would be any the wiser.</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=false>There currently isn’t a release date in place for the upcoming film, but judging by the fact that it is just filming now it’s likely we will see a release later next year at the earliest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGdopp6qr%2BMoqtmnZ6ZwG7DyK2fZq2jYrOquMyipaBn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
