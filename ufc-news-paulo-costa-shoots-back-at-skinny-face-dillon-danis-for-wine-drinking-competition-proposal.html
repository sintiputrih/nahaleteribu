Costa is the former UFC middleweight title challenger and is known for his wins over the likes of <strong>Yoel Romero, Johnny Hendricks, Uriah Hall, Luke Rockhold</strong> and many more. He last fought at UFC 278 when he defeated Rockhold in a blood fest via unanimous decision. Costa has come short only twice in his MMA career so far against former middleweight title challenger <strong>Marvin Vettori</strong> and current champion <strong>Israel Adesanya</strong>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Costa</a> is highly respected by the MMA community more for his meme game than his fighting style. Costa has a lot of gigs going on Twitter, one of them is trolling fighters here and there such as Adesanya since they’re both rivals and also trolls his friend, Paddy Pimblett. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Costa</a> can also use his troll energy to have an upper hand in serious back-and-forths. Costa’s most famous thing going on is “Secret Juice” which is a liquid that Costa ingests and makes people go suspicious about the question if he is escaping from the hands of the US-Anti Doping Agency or not, which ends up being a hilarious show on the internet for the meme makers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“I’ll go for the KO” Paulo Costa calls out Robert Whittaker with a vicious promise</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Paulo Costa vows to make Dillon Danis’ face look like a “drawing magazine”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Untitled-design-31-1024x576.jpg><p>BJJ and MMA fighter as well as internet troll <strong>Dillon Danis</strong> took to Twitter to challenge <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Costa</a> for a “wine drinking competition” where the person to get passed out would get a tattoo of wine on his face. Danis’ rise to fame came from being UFC megastar <strong>Conor McGregor’s</strong> BJJ coach in SBG Ireland.</p><p>In return, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Costa</a> quoted Danis’ tweet out and wrote “Take q look who’s looking for a free tattoo in da fuck face!

Who do you think wins if they ever fight inside the Octagon? Costa is quite the obvious answer since Danis hasn’t fought in nearly over 3 years and it’s quite usual to think that Danis might not come back to competition. Who do you think is next for Costa to fight? He has claimed that he wants to fight former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker next. Who will win that fight? Do you see Costa becoming a UFC champion in near future?</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WATCH!
