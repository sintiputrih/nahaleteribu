Once Upon a Time is missing their Huntsman after the actor left to take on the sexy, much-coveted role of Christian Grey in Fifty Shades of Grey. Producers for the ABC fairy tale drama series revealed to <a href=#>Access Hollywood</a> that they were hoping to bring Dornan back as his Huntsman character during Season 3, but the actor's schedule filming the erotic movie Fifty Shades won't allow it.</p><p>"Last year, when he did 'Welcome to Storybrooke' for us, it was fantastic to have him come back," Executive Producer<strong> Edward Kitsis</strong> told Access of his Season 2 episode, in which returns in a flashback sequence. "He's a friend of ours, he's a friend of the show and unfortunately, this year, he goes right from [Fifty Shades] to The Fall . . . " Kitsis explained of Dornan's BBC crime series.</p><p>Dornan, 31, first appeared on Once Upon A Time in 2011's Season 1 as Sheriff Graham, and after his character (spoiler alert!) was killed off, he returned as the Huntsman character at the end of Season 1 finale, and again in one episode in Season 2 during a flashback scene.</p><p>How would Dornan have been written back in for Season 3? "Ask us that after the finale," Kitsis said. "And then we will tell you exactly what we wanted to do and then you will be so bummed that we didn't get to do it, and then you will have the same look on your face that I do right now, which is sadness." Executive Producer <strong>Adam Horowitz </strong>added: "We miss him dearly."</p><p>But now that he's a big movie star, their hopes of Dornan's return to the show may be a long shot. Dornan currently is hard at work with costar <strong>Dakota Johnson</strong> on the set of Fifty Shades of Grey in Vancouver. The Irish actor landed the coveted role in the film adaptation of<strong> E.L. James</strong>' erotic bestseller after <strong>Charlie Hunnam </strong>dropped out.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"To be honest, we'd like to take credit for it, actually," Kitsis said with a laugh about Dornan's success. "We are his biggest fans."&nbsp;</p><p>"We're very, very happy for him," Horowitz added. "Obviously . . . we'd love to have him if he ever wanted to come back, but he is quite busy right now, and rightfully so. He's very talented."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGapZmaeqW70aeYp2WnpL%2Bstc2gZKimXZu2p8DYZqqhmZSawG67xWaeq52pYryvr8RmrKmnnmKubsDIppxmqKKksbavxKuqZq%2BRo8FutMimZJuZk6B6c3yQbWlpal8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
