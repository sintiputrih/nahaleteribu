I worked weekend mornings for several years and Rebecca would always be setting up for Tide and Tigers. I loved chatting with her about recipes (even though I can‚Äôt cook üòÇ). She was always encouraging me to try cooking. She was always encouraging and so positive. I loved watching her with those big football guys üòÇ Rebecca also was a regular on Good Day. She would have the most creative spreads and ideas for different gatherings! Her forte was tailgating ideas but she could do Kentucky Derby, Cinco de Mayo, Thanksgiving, you name it! She was amazing!! We are going to miss her so much üíî. Please keep her family in your thoughts and prayers üòîüòî</p><p><strong>Brian Pope</strong><br>Man it hit me like a ton of bricks this afternoon hearing an old friend passed away unexpectedly over the weekend. Rebecca Kracke Gordon used to do our tailgating segments on our ‚ÄúTide & Tigers Today‚Äù show at Fox6. She was there every Saturday morning with tons of food to feed the whole staff. She had just the absolute best, bubbly personality‚Ä¶ and she even held her own with Karle, Roger Shultz, and Tommy Jackson. Here she is the morning Pres came up and made her TV debut on the show. Rebecca treated Pres like a rock star that morning and included her in her cooking segment. Praying for her family and friends.</p><p>As we mourn the loss of Rebecca Gordon, it‚Äôs important to remember the legacy that she leaves behind. Buttermilk Lipstick will continue to be a valuable resource for cooks around the world, and her cookbooks will continue to inspire generations of home cooks. More than that, however, Rebecca‚Äôs spirit and passion for cooking will live on in the hearts of those who knew and loved her.</p><p><strong>FAQs</strong>:</p><p><strong>Who was Rebecca Gordon?</strong></p><p>Rebecca Gordon was a Owner of Buttermilk Lipstick.
