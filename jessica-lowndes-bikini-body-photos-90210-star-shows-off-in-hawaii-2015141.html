Adrianna's heating up! Former 90210 star Jessica Lowndes is catching a tan — and attention — during her current getaway in sunny Hawaii. The actress has been sharing several photos of her sexy bikini body (and bum!) via Instagram this week.
Her picture-perfect vacation began on Jan. 6, and has so far consisted of a boat excursion, poolside fun, and paddleboarding."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Former 90210 star <strong>Jessica Lowndes</strong> is catching a tan — and attention — during her current getaway in sunny Hawaii. The actress has been sharing several photos of her sexy bikini body (and bum!) via Instagram this week.</p><p>Her picture-perfect vacation began on Jan. 6, and has so far consisted of a boat excursion, poolside fun, and paddleboarding. "Making love to the sun #hawaii," she captioned a bikini selfie on Monday, Jan. 12. A few days earlier, the fresh-faced star also shared what appeared to be a topless pic. "Beach bum," she wrote.</p><p>After laying out near the ocean, Lowndes, 26, made her way to the pool. "Feeling refreshed #nofilter," she captioned. Adding in another: "Never want to leave. #heaven." In one particular shot, she rested on her stomach across a surfboard in the water, showing off her slim frame and derriere. "Magic," she wrote.</p><p>In between eating healthy snacks like yogurt and lounging in her hotel bed, Lowndes also spent time with music producer <strong>Shawn Pimental</strong>, Teen Wolf's <strong>Arden Cho</strong>, and Saturday Night Live legend <strong>Jon Lovitz</strong>(!). "Laughing til your stomach hurts… The best!" she captioned a pic of the foursome.</p><p><a href=#>Magic ?????????</a></p><p>A photo posted by Jessica Lowndes (@jessicalowndes) on Jan 13, 2015 at 7:14pm PST</p><p>Back in September 2013, the Vancouver, Canada native, best known for playing Adrianna Tate-Duncan on The CW's 90210 from 2008 to 2013, opened up about her workout regimen. "If I'm in L.A. and have time, I love going to the gym and I work with different trainers, so it's something I've just picked up. But a lot of the time I'm on location or living out of a suitcase, so I don't have time to go the gym. So basically all I do is sit-ups, push-ups, and jumping jacks (or star-jumps as you call them!), lunges and the plank, and you repeat it five times," she told <a href=#>Cosmopolitan UK </a>magazine.</p><p>"I live a healthy lifestyle and I crave healthy food," she added of her eating habits. "I love porridge, I have bizarre cravings for it. I love it with brown sugar and bananas, and I'm a huge fan of cinnamon — I put cinnamon on everything. I also have a sweet tooth and I don't like to deprive myself. I think everything in moderation is the key."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGajnaOotqStjKWmsKaUmsBursikoKehXZe8pcWMqZ%2BorJ%2Boenp8kWpnZquklr9uv8eorqxln5uzbrXNZp%2Bar5Getm5%2Bj2psamxhZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
