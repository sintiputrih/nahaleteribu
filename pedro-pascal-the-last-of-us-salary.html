Joel (Pascal), a hardened survivor, is hired to smuggle Ellie (Game of Thrones‘ Bella Ramsey), a 14-year-old girl, out of an oppressive quarantine zone. What starts as a small job soon becomes a brutal, heartbreaking journey, as they both must traverse across the U.S. and depend on each other for survival," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> summarized about the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As you can imagine, the hype is through the roof for this show.

Since it has already been confirmed that the show's first season will be ten episodes long, that works out at $600,000 per episode. That figure is apparently before tax, union fees, and anything else that has to come out of it, but it still means Pascal will be taking home a lot of money for his work."</p><p>It is pretty rare for an actor to start off his time on a series making this type of money, but Pedro Pascal brings a significant amount of name value to the project. Not only that, but the series should receive a substantial boost from having a built-in audience thanks to the success of the video game franchise. These two factors have certainly played a part in Pascal's huge salary.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Pedro Pascal Introduces ‘Dream Daughter’ To Fans</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans will still have to wait until 2023 for the series to make its debut, and with Pascal on board, the project has a great chance of becoming a hit with critics and fans.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Pedro Pascal's 'The Mandalorian' Role</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinnpyipHqxrdKcmKVlpJ2ybrjArKtmp5ZiwrR50pqjmqqpZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
