McCoy was upset when the couple announced on social media that they were looking to "extend their family." "I did see the reveal of them expecting and expanding their family and I didn't know anything about it as well," she said on an episode of the "It's Tricky with Raquel Harper" podcast in February 2022.</p><p dir=ltr>The "Give It 2 You" rapper was upset that her sister went to the media with her qualms. "I feel like we should handle our personal stuff or any questions that we have for each other amongst each other," Brat said on an episode of "Brat Loves Judy" which aired June 2022. That frustration led to a tense exchange between McCoy and her sister's wife. "There's a thing that keeps happening that [Brat] doesn't talk to you about, but it affects her emotionally," the hair care <a href=#>CEO said</a>. That criticism was not well-received by McCoy who went on the defensive.</p><p dir=ltr>Meanwhile, Brat confronted her sister over airing family grievances. She also tried to play peacekeeper between her wife and McCoy. Although, the "Cocktails with Queens" host put the blame on Dupart. "Whatever she come with, I'm coming with too," McCoy <a href=#>said</a>. Despite that setback, the sisters had made significant progress towards reconciliation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamphbYB0gY6tn55lk6S6sbjInJitnZRiv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxecGeq7CdlaN6pa2Mm6marF2Wu6V5x56pZquZqMGmvoyloKyZopbGpnnMnJqosV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
