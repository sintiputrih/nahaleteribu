The pair met in the early 1990s and went on to be married for over 25 years, with five beautiful children. As they have spent the last two decades together, Tish and Billy have gone through many ups and downs, including scandals that hit the tabloids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before Laticia Jean Finley (AKA Tish) met Billy Ray Cyrus, she was married at age 19, to a local drummer named Baxter Neal Helson. Tish and Baxter had two children, whom Billy later adopted: Brandi and Trace Cyrus. At the time, Billy was also married. The Achy Breaky Heart singer was in a five-year-old marriage, and his then-wife was Cindy Smith.</p><p>Billy and Tish decided to marry in secret, as Billy's record company was opposed to their union. However, prior to their marriage, while Tish gave birth to Miley Cyrus (who was<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> destined for fame and fortune</a>)&nbsp;in November 1992, Billy fathered a child with another woman, Kristin Luckey.</p><p>The Old Town Road singer finally married Miley's mother in 1993. Tish was soon pregnant again, with their second child, Braison. Billy and Tish went on to have three children together -&nbsp;Noah Cyrus, who has<a href=#> a touch of Miley's wild spirit</a>,&nbsp;is their youngest child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the couple has been famous for most of their lives, their private lives have been made public quite often. In this article, we will reveal real facts about their relationship, which has been portrayed as unstable by the media in the past.</p><h2 id=they-follow-each-other-on-social-media><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>They Follow Each Other On Social Media</span></h2><p>In today's day and age, a famous couple's problems can easily be exposed through their social media pages. Many well-known breakups have been uncovered when two famous people have unfollowed each other on Instagram! So, the fact that Billy Ray Cyrus (he's a musician&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that also acts</a>)&nbsp;and Tish Cyrus follow each other on social media is undeniably an excellent&nbsp;sign.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lili Reinhart Admits She Has Depression And Explains Why She Unfollowed Cole Sprouse</a></span></p><h2 id=tish-was-filmed-cheering-at-billy-s-performance><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Tish Was Filmed Cheering At Billy's Performance</span></h2><p>Another sign of a healthy relationship is when each party supports the other. Communication is key, while supportiveness is an excellent sign that love is real. Therefore, when Tish was caught on camera cheering on her husband at the 2020 Grammy Awards, we had to assume that the two famous parents were on excellent terms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Billy Ray Cyrus was performing Old Town Road alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lil X Nas</a>, Tish was in the audience, applauding and cheering. She is a supportive fan who is probably Billy's biggest fan.</p><h2 id=miley-appeared-very-angry-when-she-was-asked-about-her-parents-divorce><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Miley Appeared Very Angry When She Was Asked About Her Parents' Divorce</span></h2><p>Unfortunately, things weren't going as smoothly for the couple before a couple of years ago. Six years ago, Billy and Tish hit a rough patch, and their struggles were made public, for the whole world to read about. Paparazzi were naturally desperate for candid pics of Billy Ray and Tish.</p><p>Miley, who was then aged 20, was filmed while being asked questions about her parents' alleged divorce. The singer obviously didn't like being ambushed with such private questions; she was captured in a very angry state. Naturally, this only&nbsp;increased the rumors about Tish and Billy's divorce.</p><h2 id=they-still-post-photos-of-each-other><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>They Still Post Photos Of Each Other</span></h2><p>Now that the famous parents are back on track, and even follow each other on social media, they haven't hesitated to share some of their private moments with the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On both Billy's and Tish's Instagrams, pictures of their family (and even old couple photos) can be found. We are happy to see that Miley's parents are also part of the "Instagram official" club.</p><h2 id=billy-filed-for-divorce-in-2010><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Billy Filed For Divorce In 2010</span></h2><p>The reason why there have been questions concerning Billy and Tish's marriage is that they are known to have separated at least twice.</p><p>In 2010, when Billy was 40-years-old and Tish was 34-years-old, the Achy Breaky Heart singer filed for divorce after seven years of marriage. The official reason for Billy's wish to divorce Tish was cited as "irreconcilable differences".</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lesser Known Facts About Channing Tatum And Jenna Dewan's Divorce</a></span></p><h2 id=in-2011-billy-dropped-the-filing><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>In 2011, Billy Dropped The Filing</span></h2><p>Just like the time he made the decision to spend the rest of his life with Tish, after dating both Tish and Kristin, Billy Ray Cyrus chose to continue his life with Tish. Indeed, one year after filing for divorce, the country star decided to drop his divorce petition.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Billy and Tish's love for each other certainly proved itself to be much stronger than many would have thought.</p><h2 id=tish-then-filed-for-divorce-in-2013><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Tish Then Filed For Divorce In 2013</span></h2><p>Things were back to being shaky for the two Southern parents. In 2013, a second divorce was filed in the Cyrus family. Only this time, it was petitioned by Tish. After 19 years of being married, Tish was filing for divorce. She also cited "irreconcilable differences".</p><p>The reason why Billy and Tish's marriage was on the rocks has always remained a secret.</p><h2 id=they-went-to-couple-therapy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They Went To Couple Therapy</span></h2><p>Following Tish's divorce petition, it was revealed in different publications that the couple wished to do what was best for their family, and even wanted to work on their relationship. Therefore, instead of giving up on their love story, the country star and his devoted wife gave their marriage another shot. They made this commitment after couples therapy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Billy and Tish later revealed that they had both woken up one day and realized that they truly loved each other. They decided to work on their relationship, with the help of a professional.</p><h2 id=in-2017-the-divorce-was-once-again-dismissed><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>In 2017, The Divorce Was Once Again Dismissed</span></h2><p>Despite fame and the negative impact that Hollywood can have on a marriage, Billy and Tish came out stronger. They got closer after their attempts to divorce each other. It seems that couples therapy did actually pay off - it brought the pair together again.</p><p>In 2017, their divorce was officially dismissed, as neither showed up to court. The famous couple didn't even bother to pursue legal action in order to end their then-23-year marriage.</p><h2 id=they-both-recently-revealed-that-their-family-was-stronger-than-ever><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Both Recently Revealed That Their Family Was Stronger Than Ever</span></h2><p>After over two decades of marriage, filled with good and bad times, Billy and Tish have reached a place of peace and happiness. They have been married to each other for over 25 years now, and appear to have finally found true happiness with each other.</p><p>Miley's parents have even revealed in interviews that their family has become a stronger unit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Hemsworth Talks About Balancing His Career With Family Life</a></span></p><h2 id=billy-and-tish-share-their-love-for-smoking-weed><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Billy And Tish Share Their Love For Smoking Weed</span></h2><p>Although they haven't been so open about it in the past, Billy and Tish share the same appreciation for weed. It isn't a secret that sharing similar passions and hobbies makes for a long-lasting relationship. Who knew that smoking some pot could strengthen a romantic relationship?</p><p>The pair often share pictures of them that relate to marijuana.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus Maybe Having A Great Time With Cody Simpson But She Is Clearly Homesick</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZoqScrnqzrdhmmKecXam2tLSMnLCrraNiuqK%2B0aKYoJ1dmba3u9GcnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
