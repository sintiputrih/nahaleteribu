This past year Sophia was bullied for not having a father at her old public school, I thought why would any child not understand that’s out of ones control and no one would ask for that, in a world full of ignorance and wrong doing I’m happy to say my daughter knows her truth and has strength in that beyond the ignorance. This year I saw an employer long time production and my mother try to use my loss as their gain for heartache and to act as though they cared about my health and supported the struggles of the loss of Derek I go through, but for years they could not let it be at peace as nothing needs to be relived and this year of review has spoken for those who can not live life peacefully with you and support your growth and are not excited for your future and living better, happier, healthier are no longer welcome. Don’t ever manipulate or take advantage of a mother or child as they go through loss & challenges it’s disgustingly evil. Thank you Daddy Derek for always watching over us and this year we’re at peace and happy with the loving support of family who live by this and we’re in loving spirits on our Hong Kong trip as Derek would love the heights & the water of Hong Kong island as he did of his rock queries. With Love, Farrah & Sophia for those who want peace, life, love, happiness and a new chapter #Strength #wellness #peace #happy #rip #love #loss #live</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>Farrah Abraham</a> (@farrah__abraham) on Dec 28, 2017 at 12:32pm PST</p><p>The Love Through Limelight author also rehashed some of her own recent issues. “This year I saw an employer longtime production and my mother try to use my loss as their gain for heartache and to act as though they cared about my health and supported the struggles of the loss of Derek I go through,” she shared. “But for years they could not let it be at peace as nothing needs to be relived.”</p><p>Abraham and her daughter are currently on vacation in Hong Kong, China, and she said her ex would’ve loved it there. “Thank you Daddy Derek for always watching over us and this year we’re at peace and happy with the loving support of family who live by this,” she wrote. “We’re in loving spirits on our Hong Kong trip as Derek would love the heights & the water of Hong Kong island as he did of his rock queries.”</p><p>A similar photo was shared on Thursday on Sophia’s Instagram, which her mom manages, of Underwood’s grave surrounded with Christmas decorations. “I love this photo from my grandpa Jerry, love the snow, Love my Daddy Derek ❤️❤️❤️ in memory of my dad,” the caption reads.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Underwood died in a car crash on December 28, 2008, just two months before his daughter was born.

Derek was the father of the baby I was carrying inside me. He was my first love, my only true love,” she recalled of the moment she heard the bad news. “Now Derek was gone forever, and so was my happy ending.”</p><p>For <a href=#>his birthday on May 8</a>, Abraham shared <a href=#>another Instagram photo of his grave</a>&nbsp;and captioned it: “Happy Birthday Daddy Derek!
