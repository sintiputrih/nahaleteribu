In an interview with Vogue UK released on February 23, the 42-year-old celebrity disclosed an awkward encounter with the 70-year-old s*x criminal at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival when she was only 19:</p><p>“I was frightened and stressed out.”</p><p>Paris Hilton was at the film festival to attend the annual amfAR dinner, which was emceed by Harvey Weinstein that year. She mentioned meeting the director a day before the occasion while having brunch with a friend:</p><p>“He approached the table and said, ‘Ah, you want to be an actress?'” ‘Yes, I really want to be in a movie,’ I said. I was an adolescent at the time, so he amazed me. ‘Oh my goodness, Harvey Weinstein is so amazing!’ I exclaimed, and he replied, ‘Well, we should meet. You are welcome to come up to my chamber and peruse screenplays’… and I didn’t want to go, so I didn’t.”</p><h2>Harvey Weinstein once accompanied Paris Hilton to the restroom.</h2><p>In the same conversation, Paris Hilton disclosed that the next evening, Harvey Weinstein reportedly trailed her to the restroom and asked:</p><p>“Would you like to be a celebrity?”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Paris-Hilton-1.jpg alt="Paris Hilton" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She went on to say:</p><p>“I went into the restroom, and he followed. He attempted to unlock the door by pounding and bashing on it. And I refused to open it because I was thinking, ‘I’m in a cubicle, why do you want to come in here?’ And I simply refused to open it. And security arrived and actually dragged him away, screaming, ‘This is my celebration,’ and going insane. It terrified and frightened me.”</p><p>Before meeting Weinstein at the Cannes Film Festival, Hilton discussed the allegations regarding his sexual behavior, saying that everyone knew what he was like but spoke out against it:</p><p>“Yes, and it was just someone so strong in Hollywood who everyone feared. I didn’t want to say anything about it because I didn’t want people to get angry at me for saying anything because it was already known. He was exactly like that, and folks said, ‘OK, just turn a blind eye.'”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Harvey-Weinstein.jpg alt="Harvey Weinstein" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Hilton’s talk comes on the same day that Harvey was sentenced to 16 years in prison for three counts of r*pe and sexual assault in Los Angeles.&nbsp;The former film director was already receiving a 23-year sentence in New York after being found guilty of r*pe and s*xual assault during a judicial trial in that state in 2020.
