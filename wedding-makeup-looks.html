After all, your nails can enhance your look while your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>hairstyle</a> brings it all together. Still, you can't talk about bridal beauty without mentioning makeup. But with so many wedding makeup looks to choose from, where do you even start? "With wedding makeup, I've found that traditional, recurring beauty staples are the most optimal way to achieve the best glam on your big day," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Sir John</a>, L'Oréal Paris US makeup artist and creative director tells InStyle. To learn more, we tapped Sir John and a few other celebrity MUAs to bring you the best of wedding day makeup inspiration out there. From radiant skin to statement lips, there's something for every bride.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep scrolling for our roundup of MUA-approved wedding makeup looks for your big day — plus, hacks for easy application, and what to do if you have acne-prone or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sensitive skin</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-wedding-makeup-looks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Wedding Makeup Looks</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Bold Eyes</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As much as we love a statement lip (more on that, ahead), statement eyes are also having a bridal moment. "Bold eyes are big this wedding season," says Amy Chou Granger, co-founder of makeup brand <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>M2U NYC</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you want to go with classic black, or you want to add in some color, Chanel makeup artist, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Kate Lee</a> recommends using <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Chanel's Stylo Yeux Waterproof Eyeliners.</a> "You can literally draw on the eyelids with this product," she says. "Lines in the socket and stylized shapes with a bright color are always fun. If you prefer something more demure, there are beautiful darker more classical shades."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sir John adds that the elongated eye is also a timeless look. "Extend your eyeliner to go a bit longer and higher than typical," he instructs. "The way you can best achieve this look isn't in the application but in the cleanup." He's a fan of <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>L'Oréal's Le Liner Signature Mechanical Eyeliner</a> as well as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Lash Paradise Mascara</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Glowing Skin</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Glowing skin</a> is always very popular for the wedding season," Chou Granger shares. "It's a soft, ethereal look that's easily achievable using a mix of luminizers and highlighters that looks beautiful on every skin tone." She recommends using her brand's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Luminizer</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Cream Blush</a> to create a glowing finish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To avoid too much shine, Sir John suggests using a few different foundations. "Apply mattifying products and formulas to the hot spots — such as the sides of the nose, underneath your eyes, the chin, between eyes, and forehead — and radiant products to parts of the face that naturally are less shiny or dewy," he tells us. "You can bring these more radiant products down to your decolletage too."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To customize your tan, Sir John likes to reach for L'Oréal's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Sublime Bronze Self-Tanning Facial Drops</a>. He follows this up with the brand's <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Infallible Pro Primer</a> and then <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Up to 24H Fresh Wear Foundation in a Powder</a> to finish. "You can also layer a mattifying powder on top of a liquid foundation for extra coverage and for a long-lasting effect," he adds.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>No Makeup Makeup</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We are seeing makeup trends in general back away from harsh contour lines and move closer to naturally looking rosy cheeks and subtle highlighter," says Chou Granger. For the eyes, the beauty founder recommends <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>M2U NYC's Eye Crayon</a> in Champagne, Copper Storm, or Passionate Pink for an elevated natural finish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As far as lips go, Lee is a huge fan of Chanel's Limited Edition Rouge Allure Lip Colour in Or Beige. "It's an incredible nude tone with a sublime gold sparkle," she explains. "Small reflective gold sparkles are great because they light up when you speak. We can rethink our approach to classic nudes by adding a touch of sparkle."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the rest of your face, try to keep things <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>as neutral as possible</a>. "Bronzed skin with a glow will give natural warmth to the face," says Sir John. "Apply highlighter where you'd naturally have the sun hit your face and don't go overboard — just a little bit of warmth."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Statement Lips</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>perfect pout</a> could be just what your bridal makeup needs. Lee recommends going for one of the 20 shades from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Chanel's Rouge Coco Bloom collection</a> (FYI: Vivacity and Radiant are her favorites from the bunch). Bonus: The lipstick also doubles as a hydrating balm, so your pout won't get dried out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lee is also a fan of Invincible and Steady from the luxury brand's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Rouge Allure Laque</a> liquid lipstick line. "It has incredible staying power but doesn't dry down completely matte like a lot of liquid formulations," she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-diy-bridal-makeup-tips></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>DIY Bridal Makeup Tips</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both Chou Granger and Lee agree that it's smart to have a few practice runs before your big day, and to always do your makeup in good light.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Pull some references of looks you like, and then try to find the colors that you would need to make it your own," Lee shares. "Ask a friend you trust for some honest advice and thoughts on your desired look. And remember, when you're using something shimmery on the eye, do that first, clean off anything that drops and then do your foundation last. Finally, remember to take what you need with you to maintain and potentially fix your makeup. Weddings can be very emotional affairs, so you'll need eye drops and Q-tips for sure."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sir John echos Lee's last point, adding that perfecting your eyeliner comes down to the way you clean it up. "Once you've applied the liner you can make your look more accentuated and snatched by carving away at the pigment."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-brides-with-acne-prone-or-sensitive-skin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Brides With Acne-Prone or Sensitive Skin</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're someone who's prone to acne or has reactive skin, Sir John says he usually recommends that his clients stay away from dairy a week prior. However, it's always a good idea to check in with a dermatologist if you're having any skin issues.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chou Granger adds that you should test out any and all products you plan to use at least a month prior to your big day. "You want to ensure products won't give you a bad reaction and that they work with your own skin type," she says. "Test out different formulas to find out which works better for your skin texture and type."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once it's time to remove your makeup after the wedding, make sure to be as gentle as possible. "The area around the eye is very delicate and glittery products have the potential to irritate, so invest in a great eye makeup remover and a great balm cleanser," advises Lee. "I like to remove eye makeup first, use a balm cleanser to break down the makeup, then use a foaming face cleanser to wash it away. If you are prone to blocked pores, it is very important to take these steps."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2iaop6xoriMppiknaWlfLixw52gp59doq6ssdSpZKWnn6DA</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
