Let us dig further to understand what happened.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Joe Rogan breaks silence on UFC 295 bus attack</h2><p>Joe Rogan recently had the privilege to host a prominent CIA agent and CEO of Portman Square Group, a global intelligence firm, Mike Baker. While having a conversation about Ukraine and Covid-19, Rogan indulged in a different direction and asked Baker whether he knew about the UFC 295 bus attack.</p><p>From Baker’s reactions, Rogan inferred that he did not know about the incident. Baker then questioned Rogan about the motive behind the attack. The 56-year-old said, “Because they were going through, blocking traffic, and the bus attempted to make its way through before the protesters. They charged the bus, smashing windows and breaking them.”</p><p>He further added, “They thought the bus was trying to run them over or something. Robbie Lawler was on the bus; he instructed everyone to stay put, saying, ‘We’re gonna need our energy if we have to fight,’ and that’s the last fu**ing person you want calm and ready to fight. I mean he would have gone out and slaughtered 20 people.”</p><p>Baker initially remarked that the protesters were fortunate that the fighters did not initiate violence. Nonetheless, what happened that night and what was Jamahal Hill’s response? Let’s find out.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>What happened on the UFC 295 bus attack?</h2><p>Jamahal Hill found himself and his team caught up in a pro-Palestinian rally in Midtown Manhattan on Friday while in town for UFC 295 at Madison Square Garden. The incident occurred as their van, occupied by Hill, his management team, and others, was surrounded by protesters marching for a ceasefire in the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict. The situation unfolded at the intersection of 41st Street and Seventh Avenue, prompting Hill to express his concerns on Instagram.</p><p>Jamahal Hill in his statement added “[We’re] trying to leave downtown,’’ Hill said in a video. “Our bus is being attacked right now by something, some protest or something that’s going on. They’re throwing, they’re breaking our windows, and all this and that. … If any of my people down here downtown and you really got me … come get these people up off our bus.”</p><p>What’s your opinion on the bus attack?
