Therefore, she must have willingly chosen to keep her wedding day to herself. Fair enough!</p><p>Although it has been two years since their marriage and several years of dating, the couple is yet to welcome their baby. Except, they adopted a fur baby in 2017.</p><p>Thus, let’s hope to see baby feet or fingers on both Spiranac and Tinoco’s Insta feed.
