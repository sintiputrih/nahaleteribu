When you have two total strangers, fundamental differences are bound to come up. And in an exclusive clip ahead of the Dec. 13 episode of MAFS, <a href=#>Clare</a> and <a href=#>Cameron</a> share details with Clare’s friends about how they’re clashing over religious values.</p><p>They aren't the first couple in the franchise to have marital issues because of religion, and they won’t be the last. But it is the biggest issue in their relationship right now. And, in some ways, the difference in opinion about religion for Clare and Cameron could make or break their future. Something tells us this isn't going away with just a simple conversation or two.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lifetime</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Clare and Cameron open up about religion on 'Married at First Sight.'</h2><p>For Clare, religion is important. And, as a result, raising her future children with religion in mind is also a priority. Cameron doesn’t see it this way, however. And in the clip, Clare opens up to her friend about Cameron’s concerns in raising children with a specific religion. They might be getting ahead of themselves, but it’s still an important conversation to have.</p><p>“He is very anti-religion, and thinks, like, if we were to raise our kids religious, it would completely brainwash them,” Clare tells her friend in the MAFS clip. “I just don’t see it that way.”</p><p>And although her friend points out that a compromise can be made in the future, Clare doesn’t seem convinced.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Elsewhere, Cameron explains to two of Clare’s other friends, “The topic of religion came up, and I am open to having a partner of any religion. But I would never want to raise my children religious.”</p><p>At the very least, Cameron understands how differently Clare feels. But that doesn’t mean this issue will just resolve itself.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Clare and Cameron have had other issues on ‘MAFS.’</h2><p>Prior to this hiccup in their marriage, Cameron and Clare dealt with some communication issues about intimacy. Neither were getting what they expected from the other person and it made for some insecurities for both Clare and Cameron.</p><p>After they spoke with one of the MAFS experts, however, they were ready to move forward. Unfortunately, now Clare and Cameron’s religious differences are an issue.</p><p>Watch Married at First Sight on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST on Lifetime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLmivsRmmKecXZiurrHRqKVmqpWhtqi1zqdkppmip7amsIyaq2aemafAtXnSop6hrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
