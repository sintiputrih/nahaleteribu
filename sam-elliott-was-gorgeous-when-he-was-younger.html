Just take a peek at the actor back in the '70s stealing a scene in "Hawaii Five-0" (seen above) alongside another Hollywood legend, <a href=#>the late Jessica Walter.</a> With thick and wavy hair, sharp features, and the same kind of smoldering look that he can still deliver these days, Elliot was the perfect person to play roles that required both acting and attractiveness.</p><p dir=ltr>However, Elliott apparently wasn't intrigued by parts that merely needed him to look good and didn't want a reputation for being the kind of star who was known for simply making audiences swoon. "I don't want to be known as a sex symbol," he said in 1976 while talking to Playgirl (via <a href=#>Biography</a>). "There's a great stigma that goes with that tag."</p><p dir=ltr>So, if Elliot wasn't keen on being labeled as a sex symbol, what did he want to be known as? Well, he added, "I want to be a Sam Elliott." Fair enough. There's certainly no doubt that he's stayed true to himself — even when that means speaking out about a problem in the industry that has to do with leaving youthful good looks behind and embracing aging.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbnFlaoZye9KapGadnKG2sMDTZq6aq12cvLOzxKisrGWnnbKveceeZLCZo2LGsMHNoJyrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
