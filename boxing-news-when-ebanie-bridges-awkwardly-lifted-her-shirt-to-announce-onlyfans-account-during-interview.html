One of her most popular moments came when she decided to lift her T-shirt in the middle of her interview with a media channel. It left the journalists and media personalities astounded.</p><p>Ebanie Bridges is quite skilled with her abilities in the boxing ring. She is the current IBF Bantamweight champion of the world after winning unanimously against <strong>Maria Cecilia Roman</strong>. But unfortunately, her boxing talent is overshadowed by her tendency to grab the media’s attention boldly. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ebanie has used the fame of other fighters</a> like <strong>Conor McGregor</strong> and <strong>Jaron Ennis</strong>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Another of her moments came during an interview after her weigh-in for her fight against Shannon O’Connell. The interviewer initially looked forward to asking her about her preparation for the upcoming fight, but he changed his mind. It was considering that Ebanie Bridges had worn an unusual outfit for a weigh-in. Any interviewer would have asked her about it before delving into other matters.</p><p>Ebanie finds this question redundant and says, “What do you mean? It’s sexy”. The boxer later promotes her newly created <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">OnlyFans</a> page, as all intelligent celebrities do. Although Ebanie Bridges’ fighting skills are elite in the Bantamweight division, her ambitious attitude toward earning fame and influence seems to be bigger than the others to the fans.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Once you go black, you don’t go back” – Fans stunned as boxing champ Ebanie Bridges teases OnlyFans Collab with 30-0 undefeated&nbsp;boxer</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ebanie-bridges-has-a-disappointing-opinion-about-fighting-in-the-ufc>Ebanie Bridges has a disappointing opinion about fighting in the UFC</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Q_1688716884-1024x768.jpg><p>The women’s bantamweight champion under the IBF might be criticized for her tendencies to appeal to her audience through her looks, but that’s not all the Australian has. No one can deny the respect that Ebanie has earned through her performances in the ring against formidable opponents. Naturally, this compels fans to wonder if she’ll pursue other combat sports formats like MMA.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Ebanie Bridges states that she fancies“getting hit in the face with an elbow or a knee.” She explains how she is content, boxing with her gloves on rather than endangering herself by increasing the chances of her ankle or hand getting snapped. Ebanie also clarifies that MMA is a much more brutal sport and gives “hats off” to people who participate in it.</p><p>Having an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">elite boxer like Bridges</a> in the UFC is a fascinating idea. Her presence in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bantamweight division</a> would intrigue many fighting enthusiasts. But hearing about her disinterest in getting involved with the Octagon can only disappoint many fight fans worldwide.</p><p><strong>In case you missed it:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57waivoqaXYrumw9JmrqGdnmKyo63NopxmmqKesaix0maYsKOnlr%2BluNhmo6KepJqxbrTEq2SsoJmnwW7AzmaYp6afqruksYyopaWxlpa7tHnAnJqorZ6peqXB0aKloGWZo8GmvtWinLBn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
