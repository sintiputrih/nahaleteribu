So I make no excuses about it, but it just gives you an idea, why does somebody do that?” she added. “They do that for money … and for me, it was an easier way to make money and it allowed me to stay home and try to be a better mom, which was my primary purpose.”</p><p>Although Curtis <a href=#>enjoyed her different acting roles over the years</a>, she admitted that it was “met with a lot of personal strife because I’m a mother and a wife.”</p><p>The Scream Queens alum recalled how being on set for A Fish Called Wanda had her “crying on the way to work and the way back from work because I just felt s–tty” for being away from her daughter, who was 6 months old at the time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier this year, Curtis also reflected on her children as she celebrated her younger daughter <a href=#>coming out as transgender</a>. During an interview with AARP The Magazine in July, the Freaky Friday star revealed that she and Guest “have watched in wonder and pride as our son became our daughter Ruby.”</p><p>Curtis gushed about her daughter’s accomplishments as a computer gaming editor before adding that “[Ruby] and her fiancé will get married next year at a wedding <a href=#>that I will officiate.”</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZ2esm64xJ5knK2iqba0edahsGahXaW%2FsLnOrZydZamktLa%2B02aroZmkYrqit8SsZLKnpWLAqXnTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
