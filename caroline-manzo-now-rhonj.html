When the series first began, it was one of the few casts that had close-knit relationships before joining the show. Caroline divulged in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Tartick</a> that she was brought onto the series to provide balance to the cast. She definitely gave Big Matriarch energy by providing her straightforward truth about whether the ladies wanted it or not.</p><p>The original cast of The Real Housewives of New Jersey was comprised of Caroline, her sister <a href=#>Dina Manzo</a>, <a href=#>Jacqueline Laurita</a>, <a href=#>Danielle Staub</a>, and of course, <a href=#>Teresa Giudice</a>. When the series initially began, Caroline was considered to be the common denominator keeping the group going strong. She quickly became the housewife who stood at the center of each promotional photo, which is almost as telling as the reunion seating charts. So, what has Caroline Manzo been up to since RHONJ?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What has Caroline Manzo been up to since 'RHONJ?'</h2><p>Caroline left RHONJ for her own spinoff <a href=#>Manzo'd With Children</a>. Her friendship with Teresa was also completely destroyed when she accused Caroline of being a snitch. In 2013, Teresa and her then-husband, Joe Giudice, were both charged with fraud after engaging in fraudulent financial activities. Years prior, while on <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live!</a> Caroline alluded to the idea that Teresa and Joe would likely be in prison at some point in the future.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Teresa Giudice had to apologize for her rat comment.</h2><p>Teresa's own comments on Watch What Happens Live! got her in hot water with Caroline's family. Being a snitch isn't a good look and the Manzo family was very offended. Caroline cut Teresa off officially after this occurred. There is a general consensus that it was most likely another associate of Joe's who tipped off the authorities. Despite this, Teresa continued to push her own narrative. <a href=#>Albie Manzo</a>, Caroline's son, shared that Teresa did apologize while on a podcast.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Caroline Manzo (@carolinemanzo)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Controversy arose on the 'Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip' set.</h2><p>Caroline had been asked a lot by Bravo to return to RHONJ as a guest but refused because she would only return as a housewife. Caroline decided to join Season 5 of <a href=#>Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip</a>. Filming took place in Morocco, and midway through, Caroline left production abruptly. She claimed that she was sexually harassed and assaulted by Brandi Glanville. Brandi denied the accusation, saying that audio would prove her innocence. The cameras weren't rolling, but they were still mic'd.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Caroline is suing Bravo for the 'RHUGT' incident.</h2><p>The incident during RHUGT sent a <a href=#>ripple effect</a> through the Bravoverse. A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">former butler</a> from Season 2 sued Bravo for creating a dangerous environment that allegedly led him to be sexually harassed by a few of the housewives. Caroline provided him with the legal assistance that he needed and was very vocal about her own frustrations with the network. Then, in January 2024, Caroline filed her own lawsuit against Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6zu8uipZ5lnZa7u7uMp6awZaKdvK%2B2</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
