As for Jennifer Lopez, the outlet was unable to comment on whether she was still wearing her ring as the last time she was seen in public was May 16, 2024 (and there were no close-up photos of her ring finger).</p><p>There have been conflicting reports about what is going on with this couple and why they could potentially be having problems. A source told Us Weekly earlier this week that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they have not ended their marriage</a>. "Jen and Ben are having issues in their marriage," the insider said. "They started having issues a few months ago as Jen had started ramping up work commitments and prepping for her tour." <strong>Another source also alleged that they were working on their marriage</strong>. This is why the news that they could potentially not be wearing their wedding rings is such a big deal!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-been-said-about-jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-39-s-marriage>What Has Been Said About Jennifer Lopez And Ben Affleck's Marriage?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopez-8.jpg><p>It is believed that Ben Affleck <a href=#>recently left the home he shares with Jennifer Lopez</a>. However, a new report from Us Weekly appears to conflict with this timeline. A source told the publication that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Argo actor had left the home</a> "several weeks ago." It had previously been reported that Affleck is living at home in Brentwood, California (and he was photographed by TMZ coming and going). Despite this, the couple was seen <a href=#>attending a school play for Fin Affleck</a>. Lopez's child, Emme Muniz, was also in attendance. Of their meetup, a source told InTouch Weekly that they had come together for their kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Jen looked super thin and was dressed casual-chic. She didn't glam up like the last time she came to a school function," an eyewitness said. "She seemed more subdued than usual when she greeted Ben as he pulled the car up. Emme was super excited, though, jumping for joy over Fin's performance. Nothing would have stopped them coming together for the kids."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopez-with-jennifer-garner.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Jennifer Lopez Bothered As Ben Affleck Reportedly Supports Jennifer Garner After Dad’s Death">Jennifer Lopez Bothered As Ben Affleck Reportedly Supports Jennifer Garner After Dad’s Death</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Garner and Affleck's closeness has interfered with his marriage before, as Lopez is reportedly jealous.</p><p>They continued, "All the marriage drama comes second. They are putting on a united front. Jen showed up with Emme to support Fin. Emme's super attached to Fin, so it's only natural that Jen, no matter what she's going through with Ben, was there." TMZ also reported on this event, noting that Lopez and Affleck "seemed friendly," and spoke to each other at the event. Affleck reportedly also drove his wife home after.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZnqZdlrOnuMScomaroKTBtbHDZq6irJikwrV51p6bnaGenHqztc2gZKutnaS%2FtHnHnpidnZRisarCzquanmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
