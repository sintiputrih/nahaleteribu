It was really all about being with our tribe, the people we love, and enjoying Sydney.”</p><p class=p1>She added at the time: “Of course, we try to make sure [my movies] shoot during the school holidays but sometimes life doesn’t really work out that way, so then it’s just one foot in front of the other. I ask my friends how to balance things and they say, ‘You’re doing it.’ But I don’t feel like I’m doing it very well. In the end, all that matters is that everyone feels safe and loved and grounded.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatp56eeqS7y6WcrayVYrGiwsRmnpqkkZuutL%2FIZpinnF2eeqmtw2aqrpqjqa6vwMiao2arlaWus63ToqanZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
