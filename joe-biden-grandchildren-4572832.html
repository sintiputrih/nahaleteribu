The 80-year-old politician has seven grandkids, and they all adore their grandfather — or “Pop-Pop,” as they call him. “They’re crazy about me and I’m crazy about them. Every single day, I contact every one of my grandchildren,” Joe gushed on the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>SmartLess</a> podcast in Nov. 2022. Joe’s granddaughter, <strong>Maisy</strong>, supported the sweet story in a 2021 interview on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TODAY</a>. “He literally calls not just like one of us every few days,” she told host<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Jenna Bush Hager</strong></a>. “He calls me, then he calls Naomi, then he calls Finn, then he calls Natalie, then he calls Ashley …”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Joe’s been hard at work in the White House while also continuing to spend time with his family, grandkids included. So much so, that his granddaughter <strong>Naomi Biden</strong> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hosted her wedding</a> to her fiancé <strong>Peter Neal</strong> at the White House in Nov. 2022. Read on to learn about each of Joe Biden’s seven grandkids and more on his recent statement about his granddaughter, <strong>Navy Roberts</strong>.</p><h2>Naomi Biden</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/joe-bidens-grandchildren-naomi-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Joe’s eldest grandchild is <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Naomi Biden</a>, 29. Naomi is the daughter of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hunter Biden</a>&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>Kathleen Buhle</strong>, and she was named after her late aunt, Biden’s daughter who tragically died in a car accident in 1972 at 1 year old. Naomi attended the University of Pennsylvania for her undergraduate education, and she was classmates with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a>‘s daughter, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tiffany Trump</strong></a>, who coincidentally <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>walked down the aisle on Nov. 12</a>. Naomi then graduated from Columbia Law School in May 2021.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>As mentioned above, Naomi is engaged to Peter Neal, and she often documents their <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sweet relationship</a> on social media. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Naomi and Peter’s wedding</a> comes nearly 10 years after the last time the White House hosted such an event; In 2013, former <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>President Barack Obama’s</strong></a> photographer <strong>Pete Souza</strong> married<strong> Patti Lease </strong>at the historic building. Naomi revealed her nuptials would be held in an excitement-filled <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweet</a> in July 2022. “Sooo not sure how best to update but was supposed to do so weeks ago…but we have finally figured out where the ceremony will be…and much to the relief of secret service and with the dogs’ endorsement…we’ll be getting married on the South Lawn! Couldn’t be more excited,” she gushed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Naomi and Peter hired the wedding planner who has organized several high-profile events over the years, including Chelsea Clinton’s 2010 wedding, Bryan Rafanelli, per<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> <i>The New York Times</i></a>. <strong>Elizabeth Alexander</strong>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dr. Jill Biden</strong></a>‘s communications director, and <strong>Anthony Bernal</strong>, another trusted staffer, are also helping out with the planning. Although the intimate details of the wedding are unknown, Elizabeth confirmed that the Biden family will be paying for the entire wedding. “Consistent with other private events hosted by the first family and following the traditions of previous White House wedding festivities in prior administrations, the Biden family will be paying for the wedding activities that occur at the White House,” she said in a written statement to The NYT.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The Times&nbsp;also listed the potential designers that Naomi could be using for her wedding dress: Reem Acra, Christian Siriano, Veronica Beard, Ralph Lauren, and Valentino. These are all designers Naomi has favored over the years.</p><h2>Finnegan Biden</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/joe-bidens-grandchildren-finnegan-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>Finnegan Biden</strong>, 22, is Hunter and Kathleen’s second daughter. She’s named after Joe’s late mother, <strong>Catherine Eugenia Finnegan</strong>. Unlike big sister Naomi, Finnegan tends to keep a low profile in the public and on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>social media</a>. However, she did step out to campaign for her grandfather in 2020. At a Feb. 2020 <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rally in Iowa</a>, Joe introduced Finnegan to the crowd and said, “Granddaughters not only love their grandpops but they like them. And that’s the great thing. Thank you, baby.”</p><h2>Maisy Biden</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/joe-bidens-grandchildren-maisy-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>The next Biden grandkid is <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Maisy Biden</strong></a>, the 21-year-old daughter of Hunter and Kathleen. Maisy traveled a lot with Joe while he served as Vice President to Barack Obama. She even formed a close friendship with the younger Obama daughter, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sasha Obama</strong></a>. Maisy graduated from high school in 2019 and she celebrated with a family party that her loved ones attended, including Joe and his wife Jill Biden. Maisy is also active on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TikTok</a>, where she shares fun dancing and lip-syncing videos. She has over 180,000 followers on the social media platform.</p><h2>Natalie Biden</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/joe-bidens-grandchildren-natalie-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Joe’s fourth-eldest grandchild is <strong>Natalie Biden</strong>, 17. Natalie’s parents are <strong>Hallie Olivere</strong>&nbsp;and the late&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Beau Biden</strong></a> (Joe’s son who died of brain cancer in 2015.) Natalie <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spoke</a> during the second night of the <strong>2020 Democratic National Convention</strong>. She talked about First Lady Jill at the event, saying, “I would say she’s not your average grandmother. She’s a prankster, she’s very mischievous.” Natalie was also involved in her grandfather’s campaign by performing <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>an Instagram Q&A</a> to encourage voting with cousin Noami and model <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kaia Gerber</strong></a>. While she has gotten involved lightly in politics, she prefers to keep her life on the down low and has a private <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> account.</p><h2>Robert ‘Hunter’ Biden</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/joe-bidens-grandchildren-robert-hunter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>Robert ‘Hunter’ Biden II</strong>, 16, is Beau and Hallie’s youngest child. He was named after his uncle. Robert made several appearances with his grandfather throughout his time as Vice President and during the campaign trail for the 2020 election. He also appeared <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in a video</a> reciting the national anthem at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. His <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> account is public and boasts over 330,000 followers but just one post from 2021. Like his sister, he has shied away from the spotlight.</p><h2>Navy Joan Roberts</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>The sixth Biden grandchild is a girl, and her name was unknown until the <a class=body-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8937993/Meet-Joe-Bidens-seventh-grandchild-Navy-Joan-Roberts.html data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a> revealed it in November 2020. Navy, 4, is the daughter of Hunter and a woman named <strong>Lunden Alexis Roberts</strong>. Lunden gave birth to Navy in 2018 in Arkansas, though it wasn’t revealed until 2020 that Hunter was the father. According to reports, he originally denied that the child was his, but agreed to<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> pay child support</a> once a paternity test revealed him as the father.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Most recently, the president and his wife released a statement to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE&nbsp;</a>about the four-year-old and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their relationship</a> with her. “Our son Hunter and Navy’s mother, Lunden, are working together to foster a relationship that is in the best interests of their daughter, preserving her privacy as much as possible going forward,” the statement began. “This is not a political issue, it’s a family matter. Jill and I only want what is best for all of our grandchildren, including Navy.” A source close to the family told the mag that the two public figures were giving Hunter and Lunden “the space and time to figure things out.”</p><h2>Beau Biden</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/beau-biden-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16>Joe Biden’s seventh grandchild is&nbsp;<strong>Beau Biden</strong>.

The couple named their son after Hunter’s late brother. Beau’s arrival came at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, so he hasn’t been seen much in public.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8monGaamZmyr3nGq5innJOdtq2w0Z6lZmxlbH95f5Fo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
