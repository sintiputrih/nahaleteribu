Richard, who was fondly known as Junior, was born in Miramichi on October 5, 1958, and he passed away at the age of 65 on December 6, 2023, at Miramichi Regional Hospital.</p><p>Indulging in activities like hunting and fishing brought Junior great joy, and he was known for his affinity for the great outdoors. His infectious laughter and good humor were obvious to everyone who knew him. He took great pleasure in making his loved ones laugh and was the life and soul of any party he attended. Jennifer Morris (Adam), of Bellefond, and her husband, Julia, are among his cherished relatives who will miss him deeply.</p><p>Claudette (Fred) of Napan, Camillia (Willard) of Miramichi, Jeannine of Ontario, Claude (Louise) of Bellefond, Paul (Connie) of Blackville, and Aurel (Paulette) of Campbellton were all cherished siblings by Junior. A large number of his nieces, nephews, and sisters-in-law are grieving his passing. On Friday, December 8, 2023, from 12 to 1:45 pm, there will be a visitation at the Northumberland Funeral Home. The funeral service will begin at 2 pm.</p><p>In remembrance of Junior’s life and work, Father Cornelius will officiate the funeral. Donations in honor of Junior’s memory and the difference he made in the world might take the place of floral tributes by benefiting a cause near and dear to one’s heart. We will always remember Richard Morris Jr. as a kind soul who loved the outdoors, was loyal to his family, and brought happiness to his neighborhood. As part of their duty to honor Junior’s memory, the Northumberland Funeral Home is supervising the arrangements.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmanBrbHHqKysnV6asbZ61admq6GTna6zsIympquqmah6q76MqJmirKWWv7p506GcZqWZp66utcKhoGamlax6o77Up6qwoZOgeqS7zKasp6Gkrnquu9SrpaxlpJ2ybr%2FAnWSdnZ2ewKZ5zp9kmqZdpMK1sM6oqWadnqm1tr%2FImqqtZZSarrW0jK2fnmWnpL%2BtsIyomaKso2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
