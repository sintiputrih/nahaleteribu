They’ll first appear when the mutant nation of Karkoa finally opens to the outside world. The new characters will be teaming up with established heroes and villains from the Marvel universe. After their introduction, we’ll be getting a comic just for them, so it truly is a new story.</p><p data-characters=70 data-current-count=70 data-injectable=false>Marvel has given us some brief character descriptions of the G.O.D.S.:</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Wyn</h3><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>A strong magical expert who is part of an ancient hierarchy that includes omnipotent rulers of the universe like Infinity and the Living Tribunal, Wyn has spent thousands of years casting his spells in secrecy. He would have continued in the shadows, but happenings on Earth mean he has been forced to step out into the light and utilize his powers publicly. Wyn having a chance but fateful meeting with Doctor Strange appears to be the spark that begins the G.O.D.S. storyline.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Dmitri the Science Boy</h3><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=234 data-injectable=false>The much more carefree (or reckless, depending on who you ask) partner to Wyn, Dmitri aids the powerful magic man but has his own secret mission: to discover the deep, dark secrets that inform his past, and how he came to forget them.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Aiko Maki</h3><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true>A science purist and loyal agent to the point of brutality, Aiko believes in the greater good, and as a result is willing to do anything (no matter how heinous) to keep the universe in balance.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Mia the Magic Girl</h3><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false>The opposite end of the spectrum to Wyn, Mia is a much younger sorcerer who is lacking the guidance to fulfill her truly devastating potential.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Cubisk Core</h3><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>Like many previous Marvel characters, Cubisk is all about corruption. The mysterious being is elusive and frightening, but one thing is for sure: he wants to shatter the universe as we know it.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>When will these characters make their first appearance in the Marvel Universe?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Mia.png><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>Many of the G.O.D.S. are set to make their first appearance on August 2, with a dedicated comic to be released at an undetermined date in the Fall.

In a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">statement via Marvel’s website</a>, he said:</p><p>“When I came back to Marvel a few years ago, I wrote two series bibles. The first was HOUSE OF X and the other one was G.O.D.S. To say that I’m excited to finally be able to share this story with everyone is a massive understatement. G.O.D.S. takes place in its own special corner of the Marvel Universe — in the cracks that lie at the intersection of science and magic — and revisits some characters and concepts that we’ve reimagined for a more modern, continuity-driven audience.”</p><p data-characters=47 data-current-count=47 data-injectable=false>He was also incredibly complimentary of Schiti:</p><p>“I’ve had the pleasure of working with Valerio Schiti on this for the last year, and watching him bring this to life has been a total joy. G.O.D.S. is my favorite kind of Marvel comic: one that feels like something old, but pushes the Marvel Universe in an exciting new direction.”</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>Schiti returned the compliments and then some, before describing why he was also so excited by the prospect of working on the project:</p><p>“When I was given a chance to work with Jonathan on a new project, I accepted right away. Then I discovered that we would be reimagining gods in the Marvel Universe: how they work, what they do, and how they interact with each other and humanity. It’s the kind of project that makes you weak in the knees when you think about it. Luckily, Jonathan has the gift to make even the most complex stories surprisingly simple and understandable. His pitch inspired me almost immediately. The core of the story is so perfect and clear that it swept away my anxiety and turned it into a burst of creativity.”</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=242 data-injectable=false>He further discussed the process of building the characters, and the chance to do something new in a universe that many feel has been getting stale thanks to endless cinematic reboots and a focus on alternate timelines instead of new stories.</p><p>“The thing that I love the most is how the story grows, starting on the streets of New York and then taking the characters and the readers on an incredible journey with the Marvel pantheon. We will bring you to new places, show you what was hidden though the wrinkles of reality, introduce new characters, and put a fresh spin on old ones. You think you knew the Marvel Universe? Well, we will prove you wrong!”</p><p data-characters=117 data-current-count=117 data-injectable=false>So, if you’re a Marvel diehard, there’s plenty to be excited about when it comes to these new characters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTpLqqr8GopqSrX6y1sHnAq5xmpZGnw6a40malnq9dnHqwecNmqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
