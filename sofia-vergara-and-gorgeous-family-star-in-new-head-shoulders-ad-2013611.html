Head & Shoulders has been a part of my hair care regime and my family’s since I was young," the 41-year-old Colombian-born beauty announced in a statement. "In fact we joke that 8 out of 9 Vergaras use it; AND there are a LOT of us." In the first photo from the campaign, the Modern Family actress takes center stage as she is surrounded by her very, very attractive relatives, including her mother Margarita, cousins Mariana, Marianella, Rose, and Gloria, along with her niece Claudia. The Vergara family men pictured in the ad include Vergara's son Manolo and her cousin Nando.</p><p>Celebrities who have partnered with the brand in the past include Michael Phelps and NFL player Troy Polamalu, whose epic locks were declared as the "highest insured hair" in the world by the Guinness Book of World Records.</p><p>Vergara — TV's <a href=#>highest paid actress</a> according to Forbes — has multiple endorsement deals with high profile brands including Diet Pepsi, Comcast and CoverGirl. The curvy comedic star also has designed her very own clothing line for Kmart, allowing Vergara to rake in an estimated $30 million from 2012 to 2013 — and it looks like the star's earnings will continue to grow with her new Head & Shoulders deal!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The national ad campaign starring her beautiful family will launch in early 2014.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6i8p7XAZq2eqpeWv6J5wKebZp%2Bfp7Smu9SsZJ%2BZnZ65unnSrZirZZmjeq%2Bx1mafnpmUYsCpu9Slm56qo2KupXmRaWhsbmFmfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
