As a fellow critic, all I can say is: career goals. But panning so hard it drives others to kill is not the same as killing.

There could be an 11th-hour twist that somehow involves her, but now that we fully understand why her lipstick was connected to the (first) crime scene, it would be a pretty big stretch for her to be the killer.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cln0lf265005s3b7hr5jbkzaw@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Too Soon to Count Out</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b76/626/01e2d451d332cb7eed740be4551db706b5-omitb-302-ph-03941r-3k.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> Would a man with abs this perfect commit murder?

Let’s say Tobert pushed Ben down the elevator shaft, a thing I am about to say in a few paragraphs. If he were friends with Cinda — and it would make sense if they were, given that they both work in the documentary space — he might have asked her to offer Mabel a job to stop her investigation into Ben’s murder. If that is indeed why she reached out to Mabel, clearly that does not make her a murderer. But it could implicate her in the cover-up aspect of the crime.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cln0lhi8v000g3b7j68ihxbvl@published>Harry Styles</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln0lhi8x000h3b7jwhlg42ha@published data-word-count=43>What kind of lunatic not only keeps Harry Styles on this list when his name has been mentioned only once this entire season, but then upgrades him to Too Soon to Count Out when there’s only one episode left? This lunatic right here!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln0lhi9u000i3b7j3zzd2yqc@published data-word-count=164>Look, you can call my decision to put Harry in this category delusional, idiotic, or the work of a drunken miscreant who’s just trying to stir up trouble. I call it: manifesting. Like, what if Harry shows up at the very end of the season finale, AS he does in Jenny Lewis’s video for “<a href=#>Puppy and a Truck</a>,” but instead of removing his dog mask he takes off … his Tobert mask like Tom Cruise in the Mission: Impossible movies, and it turns out Tobert has been Harry this whole time, which means Harry pushed Ben down the elevator shaft and also slept with Selena Gomez, famous bestie of Harry’s ex, Taylor Swift? Tell me that wouldn’t be the most amazing thing that’s ever happened on this show and, possibly, the history of all humankind?! That’s why I’m writing it down, with the hope that putting this absurd idea into the universe will force it into becoming reality. Hey, it worked for <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a>.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cln0lhzdd000o3b7jrhdsho4b@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Most Suspicious Suspects</span></h2><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cln0llj5b00223b7jgy0stq7t@published>Donna DeMeo (Linda Emond)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/519/07b/8edd20e030d499d631e4a4672762bfd911-harry-styles.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> She may be a top-notch producer. But Donna DeMeo kinda sucks at poisoning people.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln0llj5i00233b7jeq2fzug4@published data-word-count=123>In last week’s <a href=#>analysis</a>, I wrote the following about Donna DeMeo’s nervousness <a href=#>during sitzprobe</a>: “The producer attributes her queasiness to pre-opening jitters, but it strikes me as out of character for the seemingly unflappable Donna to be that nervous during an orchestra rehearsal. She might, on the other hand, be nervous about the cops showing up unannounced to re-open Ben’s murder case, especially if she poisoned Ben so they could close Death Rattle and allow her son to avoid the ego-bruising experience of having his first show be a flop.” As the kids used to say back in 2005: Boom goes the dynamite! If I can’t gloat about being right in an ongoing citizen detective column, what’s the point of even writing one?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln0llj5u00243b7jp0hjn6sd@published data-word-count=127>Based on the timeline laid out in this week’s episode by Mabel, Charles, and Oliver, that’s exactly what Donna did. After leaning on one of her sources at the newspaper where Maxine works, she got an advance copy of Maxine’s review, immediately shredded it, then sprinkled a little rat poison on Ben’s Schmackary’s cookie, which of course Ben devoured in his dressing room. That clip of Ben telling someone he wanted them even though it would ruin his career: he was talking to a delicious baked good! It’s just like that <a href=#>episode of Seinfeld</a> where Jerry broke the non-vomit streak he had maintained since June 29, 1980: “Look to the cookie!” (And kudos to all the Vulture commenters who figured this out at least five episodes ago.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln0llj5v00253b7j46mkrphi@published data-word-count=73>Wouldn’t Ben have noticed there was poison on his cookie? I’ve never eaten rat poison, but I suspect it would not taste good. Whatever, doesn’t matter, Ben ate it, but the amount of poison Donna used was not enough to take him out. Now Mabel, Charles, and Oliver are assuming Donna also pushed Ben down the elevator shaft, which is the kind of mistake an amateur would make. I expect more from them.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln0llj5v00263b7jlvdollbb@published data-word-count=62>Donna appears to be guilty of attempted murder, a thing she perhaps plans to confess to, which is why she shows up at Loretta’s arraignment. In any case, we now know who poisoned Ben, but we still don’t know who pushed Ben, which is the important part, since the push actually killed him. Which brings us to our other potential suspects …</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cln0llzc3002j3b7jdypmfmb8@published>Loretta Durkin (Meryl Streep)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln0llzc3002k3b7jbfbtjlgs@published data-word-count=86>We know Loretta didn’t poison Ben, the part of the crime she seemed most likely to have committed. That doesn’t mean she didn’t shove him to an untimely end, though. If she were frustrated with Ben treating Dickie poorly and somehow ran into Ben before leaving the Arconia after the cast party, she easily could have done it. That feels less likely to me, though — the idea that she thinks Dickie did it and is trying to take the fall for him is more plausible.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cln0lmhyg002x3b7jprdf4iyl@published>Dickie Glenroy (Jeremy Shamos)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln0lmhyh002y3b7j3771m8q8@published data-word-count=53>Dickie’s got motive, and his comments to Loretta about reaching his breaking point after Ben miraculously survived the consumption of a defiled cookie suggest he may have snapped and accidentally offed his brother. But that wouldn’t be very surprising, and Only Murders loves to throw a shocking plot twist into its season finales.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cln0lmtrg003b3b7jvmw8n7wv@published>Cliff DeMeo (Wesley Taylor)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln0lmtrh003c3b7jikl67gzf@published data-word-count=85>What if mother and son are unwittingly both involved in Ben’s two-part murder? Maybe Cliff was <a href=#>as anxious as Jonathan</a> about having to shoulder the success or failure of a Broadway show and, without knowing Donna had masterminded the ‘ol rat poison/cookie trick, pushed Ben to his death so the show would have to close. This seems pretty unlikely to me, but it’s worth consideration, especially because this scenario links up nicely with the themes about parenthood and murder that Death Rattle Dazzle is exploring.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cln0lnmpw003p3b7jr9t25bz4@published>Tobert (Jesse Williams)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln0lnmpx003q3b7jxvj20o6a@published data-word-count=73>Tobert being the killer seems the most likely outcome. I say this for a lot of reasons: He has deceived Mabel more than once, he’s been poking around aggressively in her murder-solving business, and I am pretty sure he is the one who was talking on the phone with Det. Biswas at the end of <a href=#>episode seven</a>, getting a head’s up from a cop that the investigation into Ben’s death was being reopened.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln0lnmq6003r3b7jtt1np9rw@published data-word-count=87>There’s another reason I think Tobert did it: When Ben fires him on opening night and grabs Tobert’s camera from him, Tobert looks enraged. After learning Ben recovered, it makes complete sense that Tobert would go to Ben’s apartment to try to get his camera and footage back, get into a fight with Ben about it, then push him into the elevator during their altercation. It’s possible Dickie was there and witnessed it, which would explain his profound guilt for not doing more to save his brother.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln0lnmq7003s3b7j08psbzmz@published data-word-count=66>That all tracks so perfectly that I will be truly surprised if it’s not how the season-three murder is resolved. And then, after Tobert admits he did it, he will tear off his face, reveal he’s actually Harry Styles, and the season will end with a spirited musical number set to “As It Was,” featuring updated lyrics by Benji Pasek and Justin Paul.
