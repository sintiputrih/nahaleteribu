Interestingly, different Hollywood actors have taken turns in bringing this character to life from generation to generation. A number of these actors only got to play the role once while some of them appeared in more than one Batman film. Several other actors have also lent their voices to animated adaptations of this beloved character.

Entertainment was able to create a highly successful franchise based on the Batman character. The movie&nbsp;<i>Batman</i>&nbsp;(1989), headlined by Michael Keaton, was the first of what became a highly successful movie series. Also on the cast of the movie&nbsp;are Jack Nicholson who played the role of the supervillain Jack Napier / The Joker, Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale and Pat Hingle as Commissioner James Gordon.</p><p>Before landing the role of Batman, Michael Keaton had been typecast as a comedic actor and thus many watchers were skeptical over his ability to play a serious role. He rendered a brilliant performance in the movie which turned out to be a box-office hit and a critical success. Keaton’s <i>Batman&nbsp;</i>was also one of the highest-grossing movies of the year 1989. He reprised his lead role as Batman in film’s sequel&nbsp;Batman Returns (1992) which was also a critical and commercial success.</p><h3><strong>Val Kilmer</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Val-Kilmer-1.jpg><p>Val Kilmer replaced Michael Keaton as Batman in Batman Forever (1995), the third installment of the Batman series.

It remains the lowest-grossing live-action Batman film to date.

His first appearance as the Caped Crusader was in <i>Batman Begins</i>&nbsp;(2005), a reboot of the initial Batman series of the 1980s and 1990s.

Starring alongside the lead star were Liam Neeson as supervillain “Ra’s al Ghul”, Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, Bruce Wayne’s love interest, Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Wayne’s Butler and Gary Oldman as Commissioner James Gordon.</p><p><i>Batman Begins</i> recorded an impressive box-office outing and also received critical acclaim. Just as expected, this movie helped restore the Batman character to its original glory in mainstream culture. Christian Bale also reprised his role as Batman in 2 sequels The Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012) both of which were much more successful than the initial movie<i>. </i>The two sequels were box office monsters as each of them grossed over one billion dollars at the global box office. <i>Batman Begins&nbsp;</i>(2005),&nbsp;The Dark Knight&nbsp;(2008) and The Dark Knight Rises&nbsp;(2012)&nbsp;all make up&nbsp;<i>The Dark Knight Trilogy</i>.</p><h3><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Ben-Affleck-as-Batman.jpg><p>After Christian Bale’s successful run as Batman, the role was taken up by fellow Hollywood A-lister Ben Affleck. His first appearance as Batman was in the superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) in which he united with fellow superhero character Superman, portrayed by Henry Cavill. The film is a sequel to the Superman-centred film&nbsp;<i>Man of Steel</i> (2013) and the second installment of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) movie.</p><p>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&nbsp;made a strong debut and also set a couple of records at the box office. However, its performance waned in the weeks that followed and though the film turned a considerable profit, it did not meet up to expectations. The movie equally received negative reviews from critics.</p><p>Ben Affleck had a second attempt as Batman in&nbsp;<i>Justice League</i> (2017), the fifth installment in the DCEU and a sequel to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). Just like its prequel, the film boasts of a star-studded cast with Henry Cavill reprising his role as Superman,&nbsp;Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman,&nbsp;Jason Momoa as Aquaman and Amy Adams as Lois Lane.</p><p>Ben Affleck’s&nbsp;<i>Justice League</i> is one of the&nbsp;most expensive films ever made with a production budget of about $300 million. However, the movie performed way below expectations at the box office. Its box-office performance was below par and it remains one of the lowest-grossing movies of the DC Extended Universe. It was also met with mixed reviews by the critics. The movie did not win any major awards though Ben Affleck was nominated as the Favorite Movie Actor at 2018 Kids’ Choice Awards.</p><p>Affleck also had a cameo appearance as Batman in <i>Suicide Squad</i> (2016), the third installment in the DCEU.
