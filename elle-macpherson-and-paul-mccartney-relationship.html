McCartney has engaged in multiple high-profile romances, including a <a href=#>marriage that ended in an exceptionally-expensive divorce settlement</a>.</p><p>A single <strong><a href=#>Paul McCartney</a></strong> was once spotted having some fun with model, Elle Macpherson, which caught the public's eye in no time. Needless to say, speculation was running rampant about the pair, and people could not help but wonder if the model and the Beatle were going to be a major celebrity couple.</p><p>Let's take a look back at what took place between Paul McCartney and Elle Macpherson, and how McCartney might have had a few irons in the fire during that time.</p><h2 id=elle-macpherson-and-paul-mccartney-were-snapped-together-at-the-gq-magazine-awards>Elle Macpherson And Paul McCartney Were Snapped Together At The GQ Magazine Awards</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar52244552.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Oh, to be a Beatle!</p><p>Back when he was single and available, Paul McCartney was one of the most eligible bachelors on the planet. He was older, sure, but women couldn't help but fall for the man.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Daily Mail</a>, McCartney was snapped with model, Elle Macpherson. The pair were looking awfully cozy at the GQ Magazine Awards, and there was buzz that the pair could be an item.</p><p>"The 65-year-old singer, who had arrived at the GQ magazine awards flanked by members of his family rather than a date, enjoyed a cosy rendezvous with model Elle Macpherson," Daily Mail wrote.</p><p>The publication then gave some details about what was observed.</p><p>"Heads bowed together, they shared an intimate chat at the ceremony at the Royal Opera House in London attended by celebrities including host Sir Elton John, Madonna and Sir Michael Caine," the publication reported.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite looking good together, nothing materialized from their lovely evening together. While little is known about what happened, they clearly had a good night together at the awards show.</p><p>Interestingly, Macpherson was not the only woman that had caught Paul McCartney's eyes during that time.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/your-paragraph-text-2023-11-13t101722-146.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Ringo Starr's Interview Took An Angry Turn After Topics Of Paul McCartney And Signing Autographs Were Brought Up</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Ringo Starr wasn't impressed with the interviewers, and that was evident at the start when Paul McCartney was brought up.</span><h2 id=around-the-same-time-he-was-also-spotted-with-ren-eacute-e-zellweger>Around The Same Time, He Was Also Spotted With Renée Zellweger</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/renee-zellweger-at-the-the-thing-about-pam-fyc-event-1.jpg><p>The same site reported that Paul McCartney had himself an evening with none other than Renée Zellweger.</p><p>"I do have a big crush on Paul McCartney. I feel quite embarrassed saying it because I haven't even told him yet! I've told my friends and I think they might have told him. Well I guess if he doesn't know he will find out now," the actress said about the musician.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pair were spotted with one another multiple times, including sharing a candlelit dinner.</p><p>"It's an extremely romantic place to meet for dinner. The dining rooms are very dimly lit, mostly with candlelight. Sir Paul and Renee left separately - but they looked like they were enjoying themselves," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an observer at the restaurant said</a>.</p><p>While things seemed to be heating up, McCartney quickly cooled them down.</p><p>"We're not dating. We're in the same group of friends and that's it," he said.</p><p>Just like that, Paul McCartney effectively announced that he was still very much available. While Macpherson and Zellweger are both stunners in their own right, it's clear that the Beatle didn't quite feel the right spark with either of them.</p><p>An important detail in all of this is the timing of these perceived flings. As it were, McCartney was in the midst of finalizing one of the most notorious divorces in history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/paul-mccartney-looking-upset.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Paul McCartney Was Down $48 Million After His Biggest Court Loss Caused By His "Evil" Daughter</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Paul McCartney's second wife Heather Mills blamed Stella McCartney for their pricey split.</span><h2 id=both-women-came-on-the-heels-of-his-divorce-from-heather-mills>Both Women Came On The Heels Of His Divorce From Heather Mills</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/instar41767152.jpg><p>For the unfamiliar, Paul McCartney and Heather Mills' romance didn't last long, but it was widely covered by the media.
