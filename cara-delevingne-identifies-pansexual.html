I’m attracted to the person.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also spoke about how she perceives her own gender, adding, “The thing is with me, I change a lot. I feel different all the time. Some days, I feel more womanly. Some days, I feel more like a man.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When the Carnival Row star's career first began, she recalls being unable to fully be herself in public. She told Variety that Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced Hollywood mogul who is now serving a 23-year prison sentence for rape and sexual assault, once called her out of the blue and had a lot to say about her personal life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Harvey was one of the people that told me I couldn’t be with a woman and also be an actress,” she said. “I had to have a beard. ... To me, the idea of having a beard was—I’d heard it happen before—I just felt so disheartened by it. Do you have a conversation with a dude, and they’re like, ‘I’m going to pretend to be with you but not really love you’? I kind of think when I was pushed more that way, I realized how much more I needed to go the other way.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Delevingne recently split from her long-term girlfriend, Ashley Benson.
