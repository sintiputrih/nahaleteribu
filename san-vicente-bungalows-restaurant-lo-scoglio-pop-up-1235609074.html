The Hollywood Reporter obtained a copy of the newsletter that was distributed to members from a source. A representative for the club could not be reached for comment.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">According to that intel, high-ranking members of the family business including owner and maître d’&nbsp;Antonio de Simone and her chef brother Tommaso de Simone will fly over from their home base in Marina del Cantone, Nerano, to launch the pop-up. They won’t come alone, either, as they are said to be traveling with vegetables grown on the family farm and fish sourced from the Mediterranean that will be used to create dishes. At the Sunday Supper, guests will be able to dine “family style” at San Vicente Bungalows’ communal tables. The following Monday and Tuesday, chefs will remain in house and “serve up specials alongside our regular menu,” per the newsletter.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The restaurant is already well known among the jet-set celebrity crowd. <a href=# id=auto-tag_oprah-winfrey_1 data-tag=oprah-winfrey>Oprah Winfrey</a> was <a rel=nofollow href=#>photographed</a> this summer hopping off David Geffen’s luxury super yacht, the Rising Sun, for a meal at Lo Scoglio. Also pulling up a seat there more recently was <a href=# id=auto-tag_jennifer-lopez_1 data-tag=jennifer-lopez>Jennifer Lopez</a> and her power manager Benny Medina. Lopez has also been spotted there in years past. Other guests over the years have included <a href=# id=auto-tag_bruce-springsteen_1 data-tag=bruce-springsteen>Bruce Springsteen</a>, <a href=# id=auto-tag_rihanna_1 data-tag=rihanna>Rihanna</a>, Elton John, David Beckham, Sofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello, LeBron James, Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw, Jason Statham and many more.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Neil Patrick Harris is also a fan. He wrote about it for his own newsletter, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Wondercade</a>, and interviewed Antonio. “Lo Scoglio’s magic lies not just in the exceptional food…but in its effortless sense of hospitality. The de Simone family has built a reputation as one of the best restaurants in the world by making an endless carousel of A-list guests feel like they aren’t the guest of honor, for once. Instead, it feels like you’ve been welcomed onto a very warm and large Italian family’s back porch,” Harris wrote. “The restaurant specializes in two things: produce grown on the various plots of land in the surrounding hills that make up the de Simone family farm, and whatever&nbsp;frutti di mare&nbsp;the restaurant’s fishermen pull out of the sea each morning.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Those ingredients will soon be served at San Vicente Bungalows.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvLop2eq6SuuaZ5zZ6urGejlrtuwsicnKeslWKvtrrGmqOor6Niv6a%2F05qsq5meqXqtu4ysmqifnJ68brzOqWSuqF1mf3SBlWlwaW9kZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
