Going to the studio for a session after this, putting out all new music next year, along with at least two films I have going to theaters next year,” he added. “I’m excited about them.”</p><p>The “All Day” singer and the model, who attended multiple events together, including Coachella and Wango Tango, continuously posted about their relationship throughout 2018. “Life ain’t always easy but it’s def easier when you have a person to help you through the rough times…and to celebrate with after the accomplishments,” Maslow captioned a photo of the former couple on Instagram on November 21. “Keep those people close. Don’t settle. … #proudboyfriend #everydamnday #workhardplayhard”</p><p>The Nickelodeon alum was previously linked to his <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> season 18 partner, professional dancer <a href=#><strong>Peta Murgatroyd</strong></a>. <a href=#>“Can you tell us you’re dating?”</a> co-host <a href=#><strong>Erin Andrews</strong></a> asked the duo during the April 7, 2014, episode of DWTS. “I want a Dancing With the Stars baby.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Oh, my God,” Murgatroyd replied, as she wiped her brow. Maslow added: “You can’t have a baby while you’re dancing, alright? So that’s not gonna happen.”</p><p>The pro has since married fellow dancer <a href=#><strong>Maksim Chmerkovskiy</strong></a>. Their son, <a href=#>Shai, was born in January 2017</a>.</p><p>Reporting by Taylor Ferber</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZ2awG65wKyjqK9dnK6jvsieo5plnKS9psaMrKeloaRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
