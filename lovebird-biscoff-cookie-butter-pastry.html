Now who is the genius now? üôÇ Here‚Äôs your Lovebird Biscoff Cookie Butter Pastry. It combines <span><strong>buttery, flaky, crisp puff pastry with rich caramel cookie butter, sliced strawberries, and vanilla whipped cream</strong>.</span></p><p>Oh and did I tell you that it‚Äôs easy? It‚Äôs literally a piece of cake.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC_1461-copy.jpg alt="Lovebird Biscoff Cookie Butter Pastry by Modern Honey l www.modernhoney.com" width=3503 height=2994 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>I am full on in love with the gourmet liege waffles at Waffle Love. They make the most unique waffles that are out of this world. My darling friend owns the Waffle Love here in Arizona and when I first took a bite of her waffles, I was blown away. &nbsp;She spread Biscoff cookie butter all over my golden waffle and topped it with fresh berries and whipped cream. I wanted to move in with her and have her make me waffles daily. It was the first time that I tasted Biscoff cookie butter and have been hooked ever since.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Lovebird-Biscoff-Cookie-Butter-Puff-Pastry-1.jpg alt="Lovebird Biscoff Cookie Butter Puff Pastry with fresh Strawberries.

It‚Äôs made with puff pastry that you don‚Äôt even have to make from scratch! You literally buy it in the frozen section of the grocery store, let it chill on your counter for 30 minutes to defrost, and bake it. I mean, how easy is that? You can be devouring this Lovebird Biscoff Cookie Butter Pastry in less than an hour with very little manual labor. Okay, basically none.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC_1452-copy.jpg alt="Lovebird Biscoff Cookie Butter Pastry by Modern Honey l www.modernhoney.com" width=3862 height=2745 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>So where do you buy cookie butter? It‚Äôs available at most grocery stores and even Trader Joe‚Äôs has jumped on the cookie butter bandwagon with their own version. Don‚Äôt worry, I have taste tested both of them and would say they both pass with flying colors. You can also find it on Amazon by clicking<a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B01GGWBB94 data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><strong><span> HERE</span></strong></a>.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC_1450-copy.jpg alt="Lovebird Biscoff Cookie Butter Pastry by Modern Honey l www.modernhoney.com" width=3163 height=1824 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This is how simple this<strong> Lovebird Biscoff Cookie Butter Pastry</strong> is to make. Remove frozen puff pastry from the freezer and let thaw. Then run a knife along the puff pastry and &nbsp;cut it into six rectangles. To make the puff pastry golden, lightly brush a simple egg wash over the pastry. You can sprinkle sugar all over the pastry or cut up sugar cubes and place them on the pastry. The sugar cubes give it a nice crunch to the pastry. All that matters is that you sprinkle the pastry with some form of sugar because it‚Äôs just plain delicious.</p><p>If you want to make a stunning, show stopping dessert, unroll the puff pastry and sprinkle it with sugar. Bake it as a large square. My daughter even requested this as her birthday cake last year!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC_1453-copy.jpg alt="Lovebird Biscoff Cookie Butter Pastry by Modern Honey l www.modernhoney.com" width=4608 height=2971 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Look how pretty they turned out? They look so gourmet and my husband was so proud of me and then I showed him the box of frozen dough that I picked up at the grocery store. All props to Pepperidge Farms. They sure know what they are doing. Making puff pastry from scratch is no joke so I am grateful for this easy shortcut that comes out perfectly flaky.</p><p>I tried a few different methods when I was experimenting with this recipe. I tried baking the biscoff right into the pastry but it lost some of the creaminess of the cookie butter. You want to spread it on while the pastry is still warm so it will spread easily. If your pastry cools, just heat up your cookie butter for a few seconds before spreading.</p><p>Fresh strawberries cut the richness of the caramel gingerbread cookie butter and are the perfect match to complement it. Homemade whipped cream literally transforms any dessert. Don‚Äôt try to use Cool Whip. Just don‚Äôt do it. Say no to Cool Whip. The genuine article is always superior, in my opinion.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC_1467-copy.jpg alt="Lovebird Biscoff Cookie Butter Pastry by Modern Honey l www.modernhoney.com" width=3959 height=3037 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=block-pinterest-cta__title>Pin this now to find it later</p><a href=# title="Share on Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=wp-element-button data-postid=2421 data-pin-do=none data-social-network=Pinterest data-social-action=Pin data-social-target=https://www.modernhoney.com/lovebird-biscoff-cookie-butter-pastry/>Pin It</a><ul class=wprm-recipe-instructions readability=11.5><li id=wprm-recipe-12495-step-0-0 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=-1><p>Remove pastry sheet from oven and let defrost for 30 minutes.</p></li><li id=wprm-recipe-12495-step-0-1 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=-1><p>Heat oven to 400 degrees.</p></li><li id=wprm-recipe-12495-step-0-2 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=0><p>Unfold pastry and lay flat on greased or silpat covered baking sheet.
