Eloise has a chromosomal disorder, which has led to developmental delays, but that hasn’t stopped Richards from seeking the best treatment possible for her youngest daughter. “Every child is different,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in 2020. “You take care of your children no matter what is going on with them.”</p><p>Her words of inspiration help other parents (famous or not) keep on going on those tough days because <a href=# rel=noopener>everyone wants the best life for their child</a>.

Rather, he might learn how to write video games and start working after he graduates high school. Regardless, McHale said there’s “no other choice” than to just love Edward and see what he wants to do.</p><p>“Life throws you all sorts of things,” he said. “And the journey with the kids has not been a traditional one, because everyone else around us is doing more typical things.

The Grammy winner said the diagnosis began a “re-acclimation to life.” It also forced the exes to really come together and find “mutual ground,” like the one they have surrounding their son’s endocrinologist.</p><p>“The life that we knew changed,” the Grammy winner <a href=#>told People</a>. “It comes with a great deal of consideration and commitment in itself because we’re all managing to make certain that my child makes the right decisions to have a happy, healthy life.”</p><p>“The breeding ground of disaster is lack of communication,” he continued.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=16.365853658537><h2>Amanda Booth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1986704780.jpg><p>Amanda Booth’s son Micah (b. 2015) has Down syndrome and autism, and she has worked hard to advocate for diversity and inclusion in media and fashion.</p><p>“The only reason I ever thought I could be a model is because someone that looked like me was doing it,” she <a href=#>told People</a>. “So how do we more broadly advocate for our kids? Let’s get them on TV. Let’s put them in an advertisement so people with Down syndrome get to walk past storefronts and say, ‘Oh, that person looks like me [and think] either A, ‘I want to be a model too’ or B, ‘I want to shop here because I feel invited to.'”</p><p>“And then people who don’t have Down syndrome and walk by a store, maybe that’s their first time ever seeing someone with Down syndrome and it will get them to talk with their parents and say, ‘Oh, this person looks different than me, what’s going on here?'”</p><p>It’s an important question that Booth hopes more people will ask instead of falling into the thought process that they shouldn’t stare, shouldn’t whisper, etc.</p><p>“Now, as parents, we’re like, ‘No, let’s talk about it. Hey, are you curious?’ Like, ‘Hey, kid at the park, come and ask me why my kiddo is stimming or doing these different things and I can tell you about autism and you can learn something.'”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.8937381404175><h2>Katie Price</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/STF4644.jpg><p>Katie Price’s son Harvey (b. 2002) is partially blind, has autism spectrum disorder, and has PRader-Willis syndrome, a rare genetic condition that — among other things — can lead to constant hunger. The media personality made the tough decision in 2021 to move him into a full-time care facility.</p><p>“It’s so upsetting to think I won’t see him every day, but this is the best thing for Harvey, and we have to think positively because I don’t want him to think I’m just getting rid of him,” Price <a href=#>told Us Weekly</a>. “This is his chance to live an independent life, learn skills, and socialize with people other than me. I’m trying to get him used to me not being there all the time. But he’ll call on his iPad and say, ‘Mum, I need you,’ and I run to him…I need to get him the help he deserves because he will die if he doesn’t exercise. I’m hoping he will make friends so he can socialize at the weekends, but if he has no plans then he can come home whenever he wants.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.9407540394973><h2>Doug Flutie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1441103821.jpg><p>Doug Flutie’s son, Doug “Dougie” Flutie Jr. (b. 1992) was diagnosed with autism as a toddler and is low-functioning and nonverbal. The former NFL player and his wife established a foundation to support families affected by ASD in honor of their son.</p><p>“Dougie has taught us to keep our lives in the right perspective. He has taught us to take it one day at a time, don’t take anything for granted and appreciate everything about life, especially the small things,” <a href=#>Flutie said</a> on the Doug Flutie Jr. Foundation for Autism’s website. “But most especially he has taught us how to smile and be happy and look at every aspect of life in the most positive way possible.”</p><p>“Help others! No matter what your situation is you can use it in a positive way and help others through your experience…Things happen for a reason and we feel that Dougie’s calling was to help those affected by autism and we are so proud of Dougie and the Doug Flutie Jr. Foundation for Autism.

Pippa has Down syndrome, and she was initially fearful of the diagnosis before she realized there is no “standard, objective perfect human being.”</p><p>“The metrics of perfection are arbitrary and imposed in the service of those who fit them,” Caterina <a href=#>told PEOPLE</a>. “My daughter is perfect. Exactly the way she is.”</p><p>The diagnosis also taught her the overwhelming value of community.&nbsp;</p><p>“Parents of other kids with special needs became like instant family,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow>told&nbsp;</a><a href=#>Parents</a>.&nbsp;“It’s in moments of vulnerability that we either become insular or accept that we need others.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=14.712153518124><h2>Neil Young</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1434628540.jpg><p>Neil Young has two adult sons — Zeke (b. 1975) and Ben (b. 1978)— both of whom have cerebral palsy. Ben is also quadriplegic and nonverbal. Young has said CP is not a disease, but a “condition of life.”</p><p>“A lot of the things that we take for granted, that we can do, [Ben] can’t do,” the singer <a href=#>told&nbsp;Rolling Stone.</a> “But his soul is there, and I’m sure that he has an outlook on the world that we don’t have because of the disabilities.”</p><p>Young understandably wondered why both sons were born with the same condition. Since each has a different mother — Carrie Snodgrass and Pegi Norton, respectively — Young consulted with doctors to see if it was something about himself that caused the “condition of life,” but they said it was merely a fluke.</p><p>“[Peggy and I] have been dealing with it, and we’ve learned to turn it around into a positive thing and to keep on going.”</p><p>“Ben has taught me you never give up,” <a href=# rel=nofollow>he said</a> when Ben was a child. “You can’t say ‘This is too hard.’ It can’t be too hard. There are so many kids with challenges that are so great and yet they just keep trying. So if I come up against something that’s hard to deal with, I can handle it and it’s because of him.”</p><p>Young’s third child, Amber (b. 1984) has epilepsy, a seizure disorder which Young also suffers from.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=17.704109589041><h2>Brendan Fraser</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MAB_6780-1.jpg><p>During a conversation about his movie, The Whale, with Freddie Prinze Jr. for <a href=#>Interview Magazine</a>, Brendan Fraser shared, “My oldest son Griffin [b. 2002] has special needs. He’s autistic. He’s a big kid. He’s six foot five. He’s got big hands and feet, a big body. I understand intimately what it is to be close to a person who lives with obesity.”</p><p>He continued, “And because of the beauty of his spectrum — call it a disorder if you will, I disagree with you — he knows nothing of irony. He doesn’t know what cynicism is. You can’t insult him. He can’t insult you. He’s the happiest person and is, in my life and many others’, also the manifestation of love. Being with my kids and their mom and our family has given me such love that if ever I needed to hold something of value up to try and translate that to what was important to [my character in the film] Charlie, I didn’t have to look far.”</p><p>Fraser makes it a point to extend the care he gives to his son Griffin to other people on the spectrum. In an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>Howard Stern</a>, Fraser said he can “clock [a person] from across a convention room hall” and know they have autism.</p><p>“No matter all of the noise surrounding the hysteria that goes into the whole celebrity bullsh*t, I always, always stop the train to have a moment with them.”</p><p>He also talked about how he first handled Griffin’s diagnosis, the ways in which you have to advocate for a child with special needs, and, after Stern asked, what will happen to Griffin when Fraser and his ex-wife Afton Smith are no longer around or able to care for him.</p><p>“What can we do other than give ourselves a break and muddle our way through it together and do what works until it doesn’t work anymore, and then find something new.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.9123783031989><h2>Rosie O’Donnell</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1441965426-1.jpg><p>Rosie O’Donnell’s daughter Dakota (b. 2013) was diagnosed with autism as a toddler. The comedian opened up in a <a href=#>candid personal essay</a> for People about the journey the duo has gone on since then, and how it has changed her whole perspective on life.</p><p>“Dakota’s autism forces me to see the world from a completely different place. She’s a gift from another dimension. The things she knows — about sea anemones and tide pools. I got to 60 not knowing about the Mariana Trench,” O’Donnell wrote. “… She teaches me. To be able to see the world as she does — for me, it’s been a wonderfully magical experience.

She’s open about the fact that doctors “don’t really have a road map for her particular case,” but she’s heartened by the fact that her first word was “Dad” for Richards’ second husband, Aaron Phypers.</p><p>“I don’t know if [Eloise] is ever going to talk like a typical child,” she shared with <a href=#>People</a>. “But as a parent, you want what’s best for your children, and you just do it.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.4526315789474><h2>John Travolta</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rosieodonnell-copy.jpg><p>One of the most tragic things about John Travolta and Kelly Preston’s loss of their 16-year-old son, Jett, at their Bahamas residence was that in the aftermath, they had to go to trial after two men blackmailed the family and threatened to go public with the truth about Jett’s condition. The trial was the first time the public heard Travolta reveal what had long been rumored about his son: Jett was autistic.</p><p>“He was autistic. He suffered from a seizure disorder,” Travolta said at the trial in 2009, via <a href=#>ABC News</a>.

They ultimately thought that would look like placing her in a special education program, but a teacher in Chicago convinced them to put her in a typical first-grade class.&nbsp;</p><p>“That made us realize that we don’t have to totally buy into [the thinking] that the child has to be in a protected environment her whole life,” he said.</p><p>On her first day, the teacher introduced the other students to Mantegna’s daughter.</p><p>“This is Mia,” the teacher said. “She’s going to be a little different than the rest of you kids. She might start singing to herself, she might walk up to the blackboard, she may talk to herself, she may say some inappropriate things. It doesn’t matter. She has Autism. And we’re all going to help her.”</p><p>It was an experience that brought tears to the actor’s eyes, and he and his wife spread that message when they moved to Los Angeles.</p><p>“Just let the kids know,” he told her new teachers. “Once you include them, once you make them part of the process, the accommodation, they get it. They’re very supportive. So you don’t put them in a position where they’re wondering, ‘What’s with this girl?

Frankie-Minh Farrow is blind and was adopted from Vietnam, and Quincy Farrow struggled as a newborn after being exposed to drugs in the womb.&nbsp;</p><p>It was Mia’s son Ronan, who summed up his mother’s caregiving skills and how she raised their kids to never think about their limitations, only their possibilities.</p><p>“I am so proud of my family,” Ronan told <a href=#>Vanity Fair.</a> “I grew up across the table from Moses, who has cerebral palsy, and next to my sister Quincy, born of a drug-addicted inner-city mother, and Minh, who is blind. I could never have understood what it means to grow up blind or with cerebral palsy.

Sylvester and ex-wife Sasha Stallone set up a research fund to raise money for the National Society for Children and Adults With Autism.</p><p>The action star was also at the height of his career when the diagnosis came in, so he was often away on set and struggled to connect with his son. “There is no real father-and-son thing there,” he admitted. “I have to become his playmate. With a child like this, you have to put away your ego. You can’t force him into your world.
