He of course managed the likes of The Hart Foundation (although he had no relation to the legendary Hart family), Greg “The Hammer” Valentine, Jerry “The King” Lawler, “The Million Dollar Man”&nbsp;and of course, Hulk Hogan.</p><p>He is also quite the accomplished musician, as many of his fans well know. He went into this all – his music, producing music for wrestling and if he still hangs out with The Hulkster – in an interview with Fightful. He said:</p><p>“Oh, my gosh. Of course, me and Hulkster still hanging out together. But we’re doing promotion for WWE. They bring me out for a lot of the major shows and I guess a lot of the people out there still remember ‘the Mouth of the South’ Jimmy Hart and a lot of the people I use to manage. So, it’s been great.”</p><p>On producing music for wrestling, he said: “We didn’t talk too much about it back then. We did ‘Sexy Boy’ Shawn Michaels, Ted DiBiase’s song. We (did) the Road Warriors. Gosh, we did so many it’s hard to remember them all. Nasty Boys, Earthquake, Typhoon, the list just goes on. The Mountie. Remember the Mountie’s song?</p><p>Ted DiBiase did a great job. He kinda did the rap when me and my partner wrote his song, ‘Money, Money, Money.’ Shawn Michaels did a good job. When we took Shawn in and I cut ‘Sexy Boy’ that we wrote with Shawn Michaels. So, he was good. But, the Honky Tonk Man had the best voice of all.</p><p>The Rougeau’s we did, ‘We don’t like heavy metal. We don’t like rock and roll. All we like to listen to is Barry Manilow. Hey!’ People would boo them out of the building. If I said Metallica or Led Zeppelin, people would say, ‘Yeah! That’s cool!’ So, we kinda did reverse psychology.”</p><p>Jimmy Hart is perhaps one of the most recognizable faces from the Golden Era of wrestling and beyond. His contributions to the industry have been immense and moving forward, he still makes appearances for WWE every now and again, as he states above.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>*Thanks to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fightful.com</a> for the quote.</strong></p><p>December 13, 2021 2:21 pm</p><span class=author-name>Domenic Marinelli</span> <span></span><p>Domenic Marinelli is an author and freelance writer/journalist.
