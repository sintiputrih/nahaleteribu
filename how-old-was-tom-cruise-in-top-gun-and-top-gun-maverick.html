While there were trained Navy pilots actually piloting the jets in Maverick, Cruise was still flying around in an F-18 Super Hornet, which is impressive to say the least, especially considering the huge amount of time that had passed since the first one. Naturally, that begs the question of just how old Cruise was when he was climbing inside the cockpit. Both times.</p><h2 id=h-tom-cruise-s-age-in-top-gun data-injectable=false>Tom Cruise’s age in Top Gun</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kelly-mcgillis-tom-cruise.jpg><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=503 data-injectable=true>The first Top Gun was directed by Tony Scott and released in 1986. Tom Cruise was a young man at this point in his life, as he was born in 1962, making him only 24 years old when the movie was released.</p><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=416 data-injectable=true>The film followed Lieutenant Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, a hotshot United States Naval Aviator — played by Cruise — as he is sent to attend TOPGUN, the Naval Fighter Weapons School. Alongside him is Lieutenant Nick “Goose” Bradshaw, played by Anthony Edwards, who dies halfway through the film, as well as his rival, Lieutenant Tom “Iceman” Kazansky, played by Val Kilmer.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>The fresh-faced Cruise had already been knocking around Hollywood since 1981, in such films as Risky Business and Legend, but it was Top Gun that manifested him as a bonafide action hero before his 25th birthday.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Tom Cruise’s age in Top Gun: Maverick</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Tom-Cruise-Top-Gun-Maverick-.jpg><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>Finally, almost half of his lifetime later, Cruise returned to one of his most iconic roles in Top Gun: Maverick. Directed by Joseph Kosinski, the legacy sequel continues the story of the titular character, who is now a captain, as he is picked to instruct a new team of pilots for a dangerous mission. Among these expert pilots is Bradley “Rooster” Bradshaw, the son of Goose, Maverick’s late best friend.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>Cruise’s age in Maverick is interesting in that he was technically 57 years old when the movie finished filming in 2019, but due to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, he found himself at the ripe age of 59 when it was finally premiered in theaters in May 2022.</p><p data-characters=620 data-current-count=888 data-injectable=true>Those delays didn’t hurt the film any, however, Maverick generated an eye-watering $1.4 billion at the box office and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture. It was repeatedly praised for single-handedly saving movie theaters while Cruise was deemed Hollywood’s guardian angel. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Had it not been for that December’s Avatar: The Way of Water</a>, he also would’ve had the honor of being the biggest star in the biggest film of the year. If you’re someone who believes Avatar‘s success comes from its immersive CGI alone (and not its story), you might say he still does.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>It just goes to show, that no matter his age, Cruise still has his “need for speed,” which is something that all $1.4 billion dollars’ worth of audience members can appreciate. To see him in action, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">you can stream both Top Gun and Top Gun: Maverick on Paramount Plus.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXaS5pXnWmqpmrJ%2BieqS%2B1KKqnmWZo3q1u89mnq6mXZa7pXnTqKdmn6Wjeq6t1Z6popubZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
