I think that kind of translates onto the field. Football serves for a lot of life lessons, and so it allows me to stay humble and continue to work.”―&nbsp;Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“If you’re a competitor, you want to win. That’s enough to play for, simple as that.”―&nbsp;Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“If there’s one perk, it’s being the quarterback of America’s team and being able to make a difference off the field.”―&nbsp;Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“I want to go where I’m the difference.

And then you go to the other side, and people have been in jail.”―&nbsp;Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“I’ve always had high expectations of myself.

I have great teammates and great coaches that do the right things around me that allows me to just focus on the game of football.”― Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“THE GAME OF FOOTBALL IS SOMETHING I DEARLY LOVE, AND THERE’S NOTHING ELSE I’D RATHER BE DOING.”― DAK PRESCOTT</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“I am smarter because I stayed in school, and I am a better football player.”― Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>“There are a lot of guys who play in pro-style offenses who are not prepared when they come out of college. Either you’re coaching the quarterback to be a quarterback, or you’re not.”― Dak Prescott</strong></p></li><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Quotes</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Florence Griffith Joyner Top 18 Quotes</a></h3>Florence Griffith Joyner was a track and field athlete from the United States who was born on December 21, 1959.
