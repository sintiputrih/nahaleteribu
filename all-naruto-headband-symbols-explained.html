The headband is the most important piece in Naruto’s world-building, as it helps identify the characters.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>The headband symbols</h3><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>The headband in Naruto is called a “forehead protector,” which is given to shinobi who graduated from the academy, to symbolize their journey to becoming a ninja. Each headband has an engraving on it to symbolize the hidden village where each shinobi comes from, but some have other added details that symbolize their allegiance to the village.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>The genin headband</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Team-7.png><p data-characters=597 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>We first have the headbands worn commonly by genin. These headbands feature a symbol of the villages from whence they came. The most popular one is the symbol from the Hidden Leaf Village worn by Naruto, which has a symbol of a leaf. Some of the other symbols that fall into this category are the headbands worn by Village Hidden by Sound, shaped like a music note, the four vertical lines seen on those from Village Hidden by Rain, the one that looks like the letter “I” worn by those from Village Hidden by Sand, and the four diagonal lines worn by those from Village Hidden by Mist.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Strikethrough headbands</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Akatsuki-Ranked.jpg><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>There are some shinobi who renounce their allegiance to their village. Their headbands will have a strikethrough on top of the village symbol, identifying them as missing-nin or rogue ninjas. Those who wear this type of headband are usually members of the Akatsuki.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Ninja coalition bands</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Allied-forces.png><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>Another headband seen in Naruto has this Japanese symbol embedded on top of the metal plate. These headbands symbolize the Allied Shinobi Forces, a coalition of ninjas from the different villages who fought together during the fourth shinobi war. The symbol on top is the kanji for shinobi.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>The wandering sage band</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-29-at-10.57.32-am.png><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>There is a headband that’s only seen on one ninja ⏤ Jiraiya. His headband has the kanji symbol for oil and he wears it so that he can enter the other villages without causing suspicion as a wandering sage. His headband does not only mean “oil,” it also symbolizes Mount Myoboku, the toad sage region.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>The Wandering Ninja Clan bands</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Wandering-ninjas.png><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true>Lastly, there are these blank headbands worn by the Wandering Ninja Clan. The reason why these headbands have no symbol on them is that these ninjas lack any allegiance to a clan. They are different from the missing-nin. These ninjas were only seen in the Naruto movie, Naruto the Movie: Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom.</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>The symbols seen in the Naruto franchise are really important. Not only do they help differentiate the different characters in the series, but they also expand upon the world-building that Naruto has to offer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6ao6Vlnpa%2FtsDOZp%2BemZSXrq%2BwjKywppqfocBusdepo5qhnpqxcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
