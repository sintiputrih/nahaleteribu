After making headlines as a socialite in New York City and appearing on the reality show The Simple Life — in which she starred alongside frenemy <a href=#><strong>Nicole Richie</strong></a> — a sex tape was released featuring Hilton and ex <a href=#><strong>Rick Salomon</strong></a>.</p><p>Legal troubles began for Hilton when she was arrested in September 2006 on a DUI charge and sentenced to 36 months of probation and had her license revoked. In February 2007, she was pulled over for speeding and subsequently served a high-profile 23-day stint at California’s Lynnwood Correctional Facility. In August 2010, she was arrested on suspicion of cocaine possession. She took a plea bargain that resulted in one year of probation, 200 hours of community service, a $2,000 fine and the completion of a drug-abuse treatment program.</p><p>However, her legal woes didn’t hinder her businesses. She launched her first perfume in 2004 and has released dozens of scents since. Hilton has more than 15 different product lines, released an album in 2006 with the hit “Stars Are Blind” and starred in several reality shows, including Cooking With Paris and Paris In Love. She also hosts the podcast “This Is Paris.”</p><p>Romantically, Hilton has been linked to <a href=#><strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Nick Carter</strong></a>, Greek shipping heirs<strong> Paris Latsis</strong> and <strong>Stavros Niarchos III</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Benji Madden</strong></a> and <strong>Cy Waits</strong>. Hilton got engaged to Leftovers alum <a href=#><strong>Chris Zylka</strong></a> in January 2018. They announced seven months later that they pushed back their wedding and ultimately called off their engagement in November 2018.</p><p>Hilton married<strong> Carter Reum</strong> in November 2021. They welcomed son Phoenix via surrogate in January 2023.</p><span>More ▾</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxnoJa%2Fqr%2BMoaClrJ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
