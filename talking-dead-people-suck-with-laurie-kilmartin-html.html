Today marks the release of Kilmartin’s new book </span><a href=#><i><span style=font-weight:400>Dead People Suck: A Guide for Survivors of the Newly Departed</span></i></a><span style=font-weight:400>. Rather than an encyclopedic volume of all things mourning, it’s a targeted guide that the author describes as “…aimed at my own sort of pain, the middle-aged loss of an older person…I wanted to start in chronological order and go from the dying person, to you’re in hospice, to you’re dead, to what do we do with this dead person, and how do we get over it or keep going.” The result is a hilarious, revealing, and unconventionally practical walk through loss and grief. I talked to Kilmartin about the new book, the deal she made with her unborn child, and leaving death behind.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgy2cn7k03j4vbmc93irbfgv@published data-word-count=19><b>I’m glad we had time to chat.

I’m not the first person to tackle death, so I was trying to make everything super, super specific to my experience with my dad and my feelings. I always worry I’m going to touch on something someone else has done because I can’t read everything and I can’t remember everything. Everything in my book is something that happened or is an offshoot of something that happened. It was a tough topic to think, “Has anyone done this?” or, “Is there a more specific angle on this that no one has done so that it’s definitely mine?”</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgy2cn7k03jivbmcn9yv85qk@published data-word-count=67><b>You definitely put so much of yourself in it.

You can’t go back and touch the tree he planted or you’ll be shot on their front lawn. It’s a constant reminder that you are temporary, my dad was temporary, and now he’s just memories for me, my sister, and people that knew him.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgy2cn7k03jkvbmcv82ofwht@published data-word-count=123><b>You get into a whole other aspect of death that I found intriguing. A lot of times when you’re dealing with a tragedy you feel guilty about doing very normal things and having very normal feelings, as if doing those things and having those feelings takes away from the tragedy itself. One of those ways that works is with sex. You have chapters like </b><b><i>Never Leave Your Dying Loved One’s Side Unless of Course It Is to Have Sex</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>All Those Sex Acts You Would Never Try While Your Parents Were Still Alive? Time to Party</i></b><b>. I found those oddly comforting.

When you’re at someone’s bedside you can’t have that same devotion 24 hours a day. I felt a little guilty when I came back from the hotel with my boyfriend because I wasn’t there for my dad’s breakfast, but I still think it was a necessary reprieve from taking care of a dying person.

I had written a lot of notes when my dad was dying because I knew I would forget a lot of stuff. I wanted to be able to remember it. I didn’t want it to be a blur. I had tons of notes to go from. Sometimes it was therapeutic, but other times I would wake up early to work on it and go, “I don’t want to feel this bad at 7:00am.” But to write a chapter properly I had to go back to that feeling and walk myself through it again so I could come up with the best jokes about it. It was slightly therapeutic, and I feel like, “Wow, I’m really done with it now.” I’m looking forward to not using my dad’s death as a source of potential material for anything. I want to be able to just deal with it on my own and not have to bring out a knife and fork and make a comedy meal out of it.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgy2cn7l03jqvbmcmnouslej@published data-word-count=7>Kilmartin’s book is <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>now available at Amazon</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgy2cn7l03jrvbmcsmuyvawh@published data-word-count=3>Photo by&nbsp;<a href=#>Mindy Tucker</a>.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Talking ‘Dead People Suck’ with Laurie Kilmartin</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlocWdgZ3y1rcukoKefXZmyorCMqZyoqJyaerTBwqRksKGknXqtrdSroJ5lm565rq3RraCnZpipuq0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
