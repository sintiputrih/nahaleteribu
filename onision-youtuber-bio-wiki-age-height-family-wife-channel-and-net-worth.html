He was a U.S. Air Force pilot who retired from the United States because of conflicts with his liberal views.</strong></p><p>As of November 2019, Greg’s main channel, Onision, has received more than 2 million subscribers and more than 330 million video views. Its auxiliary channel UhOhBro has received nearly 2 million subscribers and more than 370 million video views; its video blog channel OnisionSpeaks has gained 1.6 million subscribers and more than 550 million video views. The music video “I’m a Banana” created and performed by Jackson is his most viewed video. By April 2020, more than 80 million views have been collected.</p><h2 class="LC20lb DKV0Md"><span class=ez-toc-section id=onision-age></span><span>Onision Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Greg is 35 years old as of 2020, he was born on November 11, 1985</strong>, in Auburn, Washington, United States. He celebrates his birthday on the 11th of November every year and his birth sign is Scorpio.</p><h2 class="LC20lb DKV0Md"><span class=ez-toc-section id=onision-height-and-weight></span><span>Onision Height and Weight</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Greg stands at a height of 5 feet 10 inches (1.80 meters) and weighs 68 Kg (150 lbs). He has brown hair and grey eyes.</strong></p><h2 class="LC20lb DKV0Md"><span class=ez-toc-section id=onision-parents-and-siblings></span><span>Onision Parents and Siblings</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Greg’s parents divorced when he&nbsp;was two years old after his father was convicted of sexual assault on a minor. At the age of 15, when Gregg strangled his father to death, his father was physically injured. In response, he repeatedly strengthened his self-defense by repeatedly kicking his father’s chest.</p><p>Then he was arrested and spent some time in a youth colony. The recurring theme in Gregs’ videotape is his struggle with depression, suicidal thoughts, or behavior throughout his life. He said that he was very depressed and prone to suicide in high school but has since recovered.</p><p>He reported that due to his ongoing struggle with his personal life, he was depressed again and had suicidal thoughts as an adult. He recounts one story where he held a gun to his head while serving in the Air Force. After recovering from depression several times, he used his experience to help others serve as peer counselors.</p><p>Greg is very close to his mother, who has starred in some videos with him, including “Ghosts Caught On Camera.”</p><h2 class="LC20lb DKV0Md"><span class=ez-toc-section id=onision-girlfriend-wife-and-children></span><span>Onision Girlfriend, Wife and Children</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Greg married his first wife Sky Tantaga in 2005. The two appeared together in many Onision videos. Due to an emergency, the couple broke up with Greg in 2010. Greg claimed that the divorce was peaceful&nbsp;but later said that Tantaga had robbed her house, which showed that the breakup was more painful than he initially told the audience. The divorce case was completed in October 2011.</p><p>Greg then started a high-profile relationship with Shiloh Hoganson in 2011. Greg and Shiloh moved together in the early days of their relationship. He said that the two were separated many times in a short period of time, and then separated for two months in the summer of 2011.</p><p>During this time, Greg dated Adrienne Jorgansen, a little-known YouTuber he met online. A few weeks later, Greg met again with Shiloh and then separated again in December 2011. They have never seen each other since.</p><p>Greg married Taylor Anderson (known by his YouTube alias Laineybot) for the second time in 2012. After breaking up with Shiloh, Lainey appeared as an Onision fan at the end of 2011. Lainey started tweeting. Although they returned to Shiloh, Onision replied to her from time to time through its forums and Twitter in the following months.</p><p>When Onision (secret) flew to New Mexico (where Ella (Lainey) lives), they met in person. He decided to rent a house there until Lani graduated from high school at the age of 17. Onision and Lainey tried to keep their relationship a secret, probably because they knew the strong repercussions of dating each other (Lainey was an underage person).</p><p>Supposedly, Lainey moved to Seattle with him after graduating in June. After that, since Lainey&nbsp;was no longer a minor, the relationship between the two became public.</p><p>In early 2013, it was known that Lanie was pregnant with Onision’s baby&nbsp;Due to further reactions and threats on social media, especially threats related to babies, Lainey&nbsp;completely stopped posting photos of the baby’s belly in September. Both parties decided not to post pictures of their baby&nbsp;even after birth.</p><p>However, the boy’s reflection can be seen in the video titled “I will never stop loving you (a song for my son)” in which Onision puts on Lainey’s sunglasses. The boy’s name is believed to be Troy.</p><p>On January 26, 2016, Onision released a video titled “I Betrayed My Wife”, claiming that he was cheating with his girlfriend in Lainey at the time. He claimed that he did not do anything he didn’t want to do to his friends, but few people didn’t know that hugging that person would be considered a scam.</p><p>He added that he and Lainey&nbsp;have been divorced, but they have not yet divorced. They later announced that they would try couples therapy. The mentioned video has been posted on Greggs’ comedy channel and screened&nbsp;to attract attention.</p><h2 class="LC20lb DKV0Md"><span class=ez-toc-section id=onision-controversies></span><span>Onision Controversies</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2019, Greg and his wife Kai Avaro (formerly Lainey) were charged with foster care and child abuse. Greg&nbsp;replied: “Grooming is utter nonsense.” As mentioned earlier, Webb&nbsp;also reported Greg and Avaroe’s abuse, claiming that they texted her asking her to “tie her to the basement wall for a week, neck There’s a label on it. I’m sorry for lying.”</p><p>When a source asked for comment on these allegations, Greg asked for a $10,000 interview and said, “I do not want to participate in this circus without compensation, I should be paid to endure to [<i>sic</i>] stupidity of the current state of&nbsp;outrage/online culture.</p><p>Still, in 2019, Greg was fined $90,000 by the Washington Department of Planning and Public Works Pierce County for destroying wasteland. In December 2019, Greg announced that he had paid the fee and is currently replanting the area.</p><p>On January 9, 2020, Greg called American television reporter Chris Hansen and his lawyer Mike Morse because he knocked on his door. He described Hansen and his team as “YouTube stalkers…screaming things at him through the door”, although the footage recorded by the Hansen team on the day of the incident did not show such an incident.</p><p>He had previously asked Hansen for $350,000 for an interrogation. Morse said: “I am worried that there are two children in his house” and he “really didn’t like hearing about this guy on Have a Seat with Chris Hansen.” Since then, Greg and Avaro have filed two petitions&nbsp;against harassment, one (also on behalf of their children) against Hansen and the other against Sulzbach, the latter objected to him on January 24, according to his court database.</p><p>A criminal defense lawyer was hired in the Pierce District Court in Washington State. It turns out that Greg&nbsp;is serving the fake Chris Hansen, demanding to deny these two motions and suggesting that he consider “alternative and more effective litigation against the two defendants.” This resignation request has been approved.</p><p>Additionally, the police released a report describing an incident in September 2019 in which Greg’s two-year-old daughter fell onto a concrete driveway from a window on the second floor of Greg. However, the report went on to say that the incident was considered random and not enough to involve child protection services. The police said that the boy is recovering.</p><h2 class="LC20lb DKV0Md"><span class=ez-toc-section id=onision-salary></span><span>Onision Salary</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Greg receives an average annual salary of between $24,292 and $72,507.</strong></p><h2 class="LC20lb DKV0Md"><span class=ez-toc-section id=onision-net-worth></span><span>Onision Net Worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Greg’s net worth is estimated to be between $1 million and $5 million</strong>. This includes his assets, money, and income. His primary source of income is his career as a YouTuber, musician, and author. Through his various sources of income, Greg has been able to accumulate good fortune but prefers to lead a modest lifestyle.</p><h2 class="LC20lb DKV0Md"><span class=ez-toc-section id=onision-measurements-and-facts></span><span>Onision Measurements and Facts</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Here are some interesting facts and body measurements you should know about Onision.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=onision-wiki></span>Onision Wiki<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Names: Gregory James Daniel</strong></li><li><strong>Popular As</strong>: Onision</li><li><strong>Gender: Male</strong></li><li><strong>Occupation / Profession</strong>: YouTuber, musician, and author</li><li><strong>Nationality</strong>: American</li><li><strong>Race / Ethnicity</strong>: White</li><li><strong>Religion</strong>: Not Known</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=onision-birthday></span>Onision Birthday<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Age / How Old?</strong>: 35 (2020)</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign</strong>: Scorpio</li><li><strong>Date of Birth</strong>: November 11, 1985</li><li><strong>Place of Birth</strong>: Auburn, Washington, U.S.</li><li><strong>Birthday</strong>: November 11th</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=onision-body-measurements></span>Onision Body Measurements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Body Measurements</strong>: Not Available</li><li><strong>Height / How Tall?</strong>: 5 feet 10 inches (1.80 meters)</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 68 Kg (150 lbs)</li><li><strong>Eye Color</strong>: Grey</li><li><strong>Hair Color</strong>: Brown</li><li><strong>Shoe Size</strong>: Not Available</li><li><strong>Biceps Size</strong>: Not Available</li><li><strong>Chest Size</strong>: Not Available</li><li><strong>Waist Size</strong>: Not Available</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=onision-family-and-relationship></span>Onision Family and Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Father (Dad)</strong>: Not Known</li><li><strong>Mother</strong>: Not Known</li><li><strong>Siblings (Brothers and Sisters)</strong>: 2 sisters</li><li><strong>Marital Status</strong>: Married</li><li><strong>Wife/Spouse</strong>: Married to Taylor Anderson (m. 2012), Skye Tantaga (divorced, 2005–2011)</li><li><strong>Children</strong>: Cloey and Troy</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=onision-net-worth-and-salary></span>Onision Net Worth and Salary<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Net Worth</strong>: $1 million and $5 million</li><li><strong>Salary</strong>: $24,292 and $72,507</li><li><strong>Source of Income</strong>: YouTuber, musician, and author</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=onision-house-and-cars></span><span>Onision House and Cars</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Place of living</strong>: To be Updated</li><li><strong>Cars</strong>: Car Brand to be Updated</li></ul><h2 class="LC20lb DKV0Md"><span class=ez-toc-section id=onision-youtube-career></span><span>Onision YouTube Career</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Greg’s online content has attracted controversy and criticism from online media outlets and viewers alike, as well as allegations of misconduct in his private life.</p><p>His first channel was Onision, which was established in 2006. Greg called himself Onision in the earliest video, even though he originally intended to call himself “Greg.” In any case, since Greg founded his second channel “OnisionArchive” in 2008, the name “Onision” has been with him and his identity.</p><p>When launching the second channel, he never explained the nature of the second channel in detail&nbsp;but used it. As a secondary channel, its method is the same as that used by many YouTube users at that time; as a platform to add other content and increase the advertising revenue of the target group.</p><p>As the name suggests, OnisionArchive has been in use since 2009. As a custom file. In 2009, Greg established the non-profit activity OnisionSpeaks (referred to as Speaks to him and his fans) to increase the understanding of vegetarianism.</p><p>However, shortly after its establishment, OnisionSpeaks became its main channel for self-help and mutual consultation, which inherently caused controversy for Greg, partly because users accused him of thinking of himself as a professional. Thoughts of suicide or suicidal behavior related to depression.</p><p>Greg has never said that he believes he can provide qualified help, and often urges viewers to understand that his only suggestion is to help. In 2011, Greg opened another channel, OnisionEncore, where he mainly blogs.</p><p>In Greg, the download schedule of OnisionEncore’s channel is the most inconsistent, so neither he nor his fans think that OnisionEncore is his main channel.</p><p>He created his newest channel, UhOhBro, where he uploaded videos on how he searched and how to react in real-time&nbsp;to the various topics he searched on Google. UhOhBro is his latest channel in 2012 and he is still watching. In 2021, Onision, OnisionSpeaks, and UhOhBro channels were demonized and abandoned.</p><h2 class="LC20lb DKV0Md"><span class=ez-toc-section id=onision-novels></span><span>Onision Novels</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Greg has written two novels that are a mixture of real events and fictional ones. “Stones To Abbigale” was published on March 29th, 2015. It follows James who is described as a “better version” of Greg and exploring themes of school shootings and love. The original cover was replaced due to it depicting an inappropriate amount of blood.</p><p>His second novel “This Is Why I Hate You” was published on 11th September 2015 and is a darker book compared to his first. It has many similarities to Greg’s own experiences in the Air Force and is written in a diary form style.</p><p>Both of his books have been critiqued for having many spelling and grammar errors due to a lack of professional editors, although it is said by Onision in a video that he published the rough drafts of his books rather than the edited version. Whether it truly was an accident was never clarified.</p><h2 class="LC20lb DKV0Md"><span class=ez-toc-section id=onision-songs></span><span>Onision Songs</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>Albums</b></p><ul><li><i>Young Eye</i>&nbsp;(2009)</li><li><i>Onision</i>&nbsp;(2012)</li><li><i>Explicit</i>&nbsp;(2012)</li><li><i>Flucking Blitch</i>&nbsp;(2013)</li><li><i>Black Ink</i>&nbsp;(2014)</li><li><i>The Puppet</i>&nbsp;(2018)</li><li><i>Shut Up</i>&nbsp;(2018)</li><li><i>With Character</i>&nbsp;(2018)</li><li><i>The Banana Man</i>&nbsp;(2019)</li><li><i>I’m a Meme</i>&nbsp;(2019)</li></ul><p><b>Singles</b></p><ul><li>“I’m a Banana” (2010, re-released in 2020)</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-onision></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Onision</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-onision></span><span>Who is Onision?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>James Jackson (born Gregory James Daniel) is an American YouTuber, musician, and author, known for his primary YouTube channel, “Onision”, which featured sketches and satirical clips; videos posted to his other channels focus on personal stories covering topics such as suicide and self-harm as well as discussion with his viewers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-onision></span><span>How old is Onision?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Greg is an American national born on 11th November 1985, in Auburn, Washington, U.S.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-is-onision></span><span>How tall is Onision?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Greg stands at a height of 5 feet 10 inches (1.80 meters).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-onision-married></span><span>Is Onision married?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, Greg is married to Kai Jackson.
