Simons has been playing football since he first learned to walk. The main reason is that his dad, Rogelio, used to play football. He also worked as a coach for the Ajax youth team.</p><p>So, all Xavi ever wanted to do was play professionally like his father. After that, the man from Amsterdam spent his time, day and night, getting better at what he did. Even when he was so young, everyone could see that Simons was a very talented person.</p><p>So, when the kid was only six years old, Barcelona wanted to train him at their famous La Masia academy, which had produced players like Messi and Iniesta. After that, Xavi moved up the ranks because he did well at every youth level. So, the 16-year-old was made captain of the team for younger players.</p><p>Simons also won a lot of team and individual awards while he was at La Masia, which helped him become known as a future great.</p><h2>Xavi Simons: Career (PSG & Barcelona)</h2><p>Simons has never played a professional game, which is crazy because he already has 4.3 million followers on Instagram. Also, Xavi has only played in a real game once, which was in the UEFA Youth League during the 2019-20 season.</p><p>In the same way, the 16-year-old played five times for Paris St. Germain in the tournament and scored one goal. Simons, on the other hand, did not go to the youth academy in Paris. Instead, he came out of Barcelona’s La Masia academy, which is known all over the world.</p><p>In fact, the 16-year-old played for the Blaugrana for almost a decade before deciding to join Paris St. Germain in 2019. Even though Xavi hasn’t played for the senior team yet, everyone can see how talented and skilled he is.</p><p>So, we at Playersbio think that in five years, Simons will be talked about alongside the best players of this generation.<br>International. Since Xavi has never played for his club’s first team, it would have been surprising if the 16-year-old had already played for the senior Dutch national team.</p><p>But there won’t be any surprises today, since Simons has only played for his country’s junior team. To be more specific, the Amsterdam native played in the U-17 World Cup in 2019 and the qualifiers for the UEFA European U-17 Championship.</p><h2>Xavi Simons: Career Highlights and Awards</h2><p><strong>March 2020</strong> – He was named Goal’s “NxGn 2020′ list of 50 best wonderkids in world football.</p><p><strong>October 2020</strong> – He was included in The Guardian’s “Next Generation 2020.</p><p><strong>May 19, 2021</strong> – Simons won his first professional Trophy, The Coupe de France.</p><h2>Xavi Simons Height & Weight</h2><p>Xavi is 1.68 m (5 feet 6 inches) tall and weighs 128 lb (58 kg). People may think that the Dutch “wunderkind” is too young to compete with the best, but Simons is only 16 years old.</p><h2>Xavi Simons: Net Worth & Wage</h2><p>Thanks to his new contract with Paris Saint-Germain, <strong>Simons will have a net worth of $1 million in December 2023</strong>. To explain, the 16-year-old didn’t want to renew his contract with Barcelona, so he signed a three-year deal with the Ligue 1 champions.</p><p>Also, the contract says that the player from Amsterdam will make £1 million every year until the 2021-2022 season. So, by the time Xavi’s current contract is up, he will be worth many millions of dollars.</p><p>Simmons will make tens of millions of dollars per year when he reaches his full potential because he is one of the most talented people in the world. When it comes to Simons’s other physical assets, he has a beautiful house and a number of cars and motorbikes. He also lives a very comfortable life with his family.</p><h2>Xavi Simons Girlfriend</h2><p>As of 2022, Xavi Simons is not dating anyone. Xavi is 19 years old.
