Aside from the numerous accolades, the now-deceased host was also making quite a killing as a game show host; <a href=#>taking home a staggering $10 million per year</a> by the time <a href=#>his reign on The Price is Right came to an end</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time of his death, Barker was an extremely wealthy man, ranking among the wealthiest game show hosts of all time. As the final chapter of his life unfolds, all eyes are on Nancy Burnett, Barker’s longtime girlfriend, closest companion, and presumably, heir to his massive estate. So, what provisions did Barker make in his will, and what share of his colossal wealth will find its way to his longtime girlfriend, Nancy Burnet?</p><h2 id=just-how-much-was-bob-barker-worth-before-his-passing>Just How Much Was Bob Barker Worth Before His Passing?</h2><p>Recently deceased host Bob Barker and CBS' long-running show The Price is Right are pretty much inextricable. For a long time, the late MC was the heart and soul of the show, dedicating practically his entire life to it. After spearheading its revival in the late 1970s, Barker went on to host the show for practically half a century, a commendable achievement given the transient nature of TV shows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bob-barker.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the show's core concept remained unaltered since the 70s, fans just couldn’t get enough of Barker’s relatable persona and delightful grandpa vibes; a triumph that didn't escape the notice of CBS higher-ups. By the time the legendary host retired in 2007, he was pocketing a staggering $10 million from the show annually; making him one of the wealthiest game show hosts in history.</p><p>As of the time of his passing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barker was worth a staggering $70 million</a>.

Famous for ending episodes of The Price is Right with The Phrase, "This is Bob Barker, reminding you: Help control the pet population. Have your pet spayed or neutered," Barker spent a lot of time and resources championing for animal rights. As it turns out, a bulk of the revered host’s fortune will go to ensuring that his legacy of animal activism lives on after his death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar48403293-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ reports that Barker's will includes provisions for more than 40 animal rights groups and military nonprofits</a>.

I just said, ‘I just don’t want to be married.’ Our humor was very dry. We kidded in a way.
