The 59-year-old architect is also reportedly named a prime suspect in the death of a woman named Maureen Brainard-Barnes.</p><h2 class=split>Where does Craig Heuermann live?</h2><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Avery Davis: South Carolina boy, 6, tragically dies after being shot in a hunting accident by 17-year-old</a></p><p>Rex has a younger brother named Craig Heuermann, who is a convicted criminal, who took the life of a police captain while being "coked up” in 1988. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Fox News Digital</a> reported that the 57-year-old now lives in Chester, South Carolina, and as per his neighbor, “[Craig Heuermann] keeps saying his brother is going into retirement.”</p><p>“He told me when I first moved down here that his brother owns that lot across the road, and that his brother's going to retire down here, and when he does, everybody's leaving,” the neighbor stated, before claiming that Craig is not a good person.</p><p>He reportedly recalled that once he went to cut grass at his own property when Craig violently approached him and struck him using a "steel pole.” He added, “Out of nowhere. I called the police because I was going to shoot him, but my wife talked me out of it.&nbsp;</p><p>“We called the police, and when we talked to [Craig], he said, ‘Well, I told him not to cut grass on Sunday.’” Besides, another neighbor has asserted, “I keep my distance. … I think he's as crazy as a bed bug.”</p><h2 class=split>‘Let him receive what the girls received’</h2><p>Meanwhile, the arrest and arraignment of Rex have given a sense of relief to his alleged victims’ families. Lynn Barthelemy, the mother of Melissa, reportedly said, “I’d like him to suffer at the hands of other inmates. Let him receive what the girls received. Death is too good for him. It's too easy. Our family has suffered every day.”</p><p>“I am overwhelmed but relieved that they finally caught him. It’s been a long time coming and I never gave up hope that one day justice would be served. The suspect (Rex) deserves to rot in prison for the rest of his life. He destroyed many lives so while it won’t bring our loved ones back, it does help that one less monster is off the streets and he can’t ever hurt anyone else!” Sherre Gilbert, sister of Shannan Gilbert who is also believed to be a victim of Rex, added.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>South Carolina court imposes 27-year sentence on convicted murderer Alex Murdaugh for financial misconduct</a></p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Fox & Friends' Sean Duffy reveals how Joe Biden and Democrats are 'losing it' over Donald Trump's lasting popularity</a></p><p><a href=#>Marjorie Taylor Greene claims Joe Biden can't stay up late to attend football games, Internet says 'he's too busy being president'</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5iav6Z5w6icrGWTp66qs4yhnK6doqKur7qMpaCvnV2Wua2xxp6bZp%2BZobSwecGemJygXaC2rbjEq2SrnahitabBxKukmqaeYr2trc2noKefXam8br7EraCrnV2Wu6V5y6KtnmWToby0sYytpmagmah6o77OrZ%2Beqg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
