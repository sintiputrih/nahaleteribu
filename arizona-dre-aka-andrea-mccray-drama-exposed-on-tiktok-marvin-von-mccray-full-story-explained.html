But, who knew that this story would take on another path, and there was another hiding and the underlying reason behind it.</p><p>And, that is, despite her husband having seven seizures, Mrs. McMcCray did not take her husband to the hospital and let her husband be silently treated in their home by her. According to the reports, she did not allow Von McCray to seek medical help from a real doctor and decided for her husband’s health by herself.</p><p>After watching the TikTok video, some viewers commented that Andrea took her husband off his seizure medication.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=marvon-%e2%80%98von-mccray-full-story></span>Marvon ‘Von’ McCray Full Story<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As shared by Marcon, aka Von McCray’s wife Andrea, he started experiencing seizures due to which he had to be bedridden.</p><p>What’s strange is that though Andrea shared that Von had eight seizures in one night, she did not call 911 or any medical professionals. Instead, she went on social media and live-streamed her husband’s seizures and acted like she was the real concerned doctor.</p><p>But, the patient’s mother Latisha Bias, told the public that Von has no medical history of seizures and that Andrea claimed that she was treating his seizures from home with herbs.</p><p>At one point, this also happened when Andrea went running errands, keeping her children at home by Von’s side. She got a call from one of her children with the child telling her that Von’s seizure had appeared again. But, what she did was, instead of rushing home, she spoke to the child on one phone and instructed them on how to treat Von, and on the other hand, she began her live streams from the other phone.</p><p>According to&nbsp;New break, Von’s mom shared the police report with the private Facebook group Exposing Dre McCray. There, it wrote that Von had slipped into the coma from a suicide attempt and not from seizures. The police report also included that Von attempted to hang himself in his shed, and Andrea cut him down and called 911.</p><p>Additionally, as written by the responding officer in his report, no bruising or abrasions were present, and one rope was discovered at the scene. Von’s helpless mother, who was kept in the dark and unaware of her son’s condition, claimed that she found out about Von’s condition because of social media and not from her daughter-in-law Andrea.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=von-mccray-medical-condition-coma-where-is-he-now></span>Von McCray Medical Condition Coma- Where Is He Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>About Von McCray’s medical condition, he is still in a coma. It is found that he was transferred to a facility in Tucson, AZ. And reportedly, Andrea did not let Von’s parents and other family members visit him.</p><p>Mrs. McCray even took to her social media on May 23 and told her followers that Von had been in a coma for the last two weeks.</p><p>At this time, the hospital has prohibited all visitors and has allegedly banned Andrea from the hospital. As shared by Aunt Karen via her&nbsp;TikTok&nbsp;handle, Andrea is allegedly banned from seeing or visiting her husband Von in hospital, and the ward he is in is already locked down because of protestors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJminsewusBmm6udXZa4onnAp5urnZFiuqSv0ZqwZpyilrqiecSxp6irlZl6sLqMraCkrJ%2Bgeq6t0a%2Bgp2WmpLtuucKcqZqxXZvCrbiMrKuoqqlisrm8y5qgp52UZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
