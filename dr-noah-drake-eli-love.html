In his younger days, he attracted a multitude of Port Charles' ladies including Bobbie Spencer. Noah, being adverse to commitment, steered clear of her, even when she faked blindness to try to gain his attention.</p><p>Noah had a slight interest in Tiffany Hill, and although she was hopeful that something permanent might develop, Noah and Bobbie reconciled for a brief time. When the two finally called it quits and Noah tried to seduce Tiffany, she had lost all interest.</p><p>Noah departed GH for a new surgical position in another city, but several years later, Robin Scorpio found him drunk in a bar not far from Port Charles. Since the death of his wife, he had been on a drunken bender, not able to salvage his relationship with his son and unable to face his own state of ill health - a diseased liver.</p><p>At the time, Jason was suffering from a strange illness, and Robin somehow convinced Noah to return to consult on the case. Noah and his son both were instrumental in curing Jason, and Noah hung around to try to mend fences with Patrick. When Noah refused part of Patrick's liver to save his life, the gap between the two got even wider.</p><p>Noah worked on his relationship with Patrick and impersonated rocker Eli Love for a bit. This brought him an Anna closer. Noah then joined Doctors Without Borders when his "rocker" lifestyle brought him too close to booze.</p><p>On another visit to Port Charles, it was revealed that Dr. Matt Hunter was his son from an affair. Noah knew about him but didn't want to be part of the boy's life. He and Matt continue to have a strained relationship.</p><p>Drake Sr. returned once again to Port Charles to console Patrick over Robin's death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmoJ2emr%2BiuIyhpqyomamurXvCoZirmZOpsrO%2Fjp2pZqaflrVusNGaop5llaG2brjOr5xo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
