The Grammy winner was only in kindergarten when his mom, Lynn Harless, and dad, Randall Timberlake, decided to call it quits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/justin-timberlake-lynn-harless-eb1403e2-6003-4be0-9a3b-3c3353f56483.jpg><p>“You go through your life with your own traumas, big and small, and think, ‘It’s not that bad, I have a lot to be thankful for, my parents did the best they could,’” the former ‘NSync star told <i>THR</i>. “But then you have a child of your own, and suddenly it opens all the floodgates, and you’re like, ‘No, no, no! That childhood trauma really did f–k me up!'”</p><p>During his chat with the publication, Timberlake also dished on his early start in showbiz as a preteen in Disney’s <i>The All New Mickey Mouse Club</i>. As fans are well aware, the superstar was a cast member in the kids’ variety show alongside future ex-girlfriend <b>Britney Spears</b>, <b>Christina Aguilera</b>, <b>JC Chasez</b>, <b>Keri Russell </b>and now-fellow heartthrob <b>Ryan Gosling</b>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/justin-timberlake-mickey-mouse-club-81adf297-883c-4371-b237-5d44c32f03db.jpg><p>Although Timberlake and the <i>La La Land</i> actor, now 36, roomed together in Orlando, Florida, during their first year working for the Disney Channel, the two stars did not maintain a relationship after the series was canceled in 1996.</p><p>“We aren’t the closest of friends, for whatever reason,” Timberlake revealed. However, filming the show remains one of the Oscar-nominated musician’s most cherished experiences.</p><span class=caption></span><p>“We were at the age when you just soak in everything. We were taking acting classes, music classes, dance classes. We were learning how coverage and editing and cinematography work,” he recounted. “And being put in front of a live audience, learning how to engage the crowd to get a laugh. Honestly, it was like <i>SNL</i> for children.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajraOptq9506Kkm52ioa6ssYytmKWjo2KzosDHnqmhp5%2BZeqetwqKloGWfobFur8eio52gn6SxbsDRmqymmV2sgXeBl2tvaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
