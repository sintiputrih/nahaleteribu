Her and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kanye West</a>'s second-born, Saint West, is more of a sports fan but Kardashian hasn't let their differing interests get in the way of forming a strong bond. The socialite often supports her son at his basketball and soccer games, and they even <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">travelled around the world</a> together to meet some of his favourite athletes back in the summer.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Now that school is back in session, the 7-year-old has been spending his time learning, improving his sports skills, and continuing to give his mother grey hair. In the past, we've seen the West children sometimes catch an attitude with the paparazzi who have been present around them for their whole lives – understandably so. While his big sister seems to prefer verbally confronting or mean mugging the cameras, Saint's approach has become slyly flipping him off as Kardashian scrambles to cover his hand.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-saint-west-inherited-his-father-s-attitude>Saint West Inherited His <a href=# class=text-word>Father</a>'s Attitude</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the video above, the reality starlet and her son's friends exit a vehicle while cameras loudly flash. Immediately upon sliding out of the backseat around the 15-second mark, Saint has a sly look on his face. Seconds later, he walks toward his mother while holding a middle finger up in the direction of onlookers invading his family's privacy. "Stop it," Kardashian tells him, hiding his small hand with hers as people around laughed.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As Kim Kardashian does her best to censor young Saint West and his middle finger from the paparazzi's view, she's encouraging her <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">SKIMS</a> shoppers to consider freeing their nipples. Last week, the 43-year-old announced her new bra with a built-in nipple feature that allows people to flirtatiously flaunt their breasts while still enjoying the security and support of her shapewear. See the internet's reaction to that at the link below, and check back later for more hip-hop/pop culture news updates.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Hayley Hynes is the former Weekend Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop, she stepped down after two years in 2024 to pursue other creative opportunities but remains on staff part-time to cover music, gossip, and pop culture news.
