That February, the two began dating.&nbsp;In February 2019, the couple had their first child, daughter Ruth Ray De La Luz, after three years of dating. Franklin James, the couple’s son, was born a year later in 2020.</p><p>This was the couple’s second proposal.&nbsp;Leonard has proposed to the Chatty Broads podcast cohost before. The Bachelor alum claimed to fantasize about her boyfriend’s impending proposal in a TikTok video uploaded in June, subsequently presenting a photo of her hand with an engagement ring on it. She wrote in the caption:</p><p>“Recalling that he proposed to me three years ago, and I said no but still took photos.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bekah-Martinez-4.jpg alt="Bekah Martinez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She turned him down at the moment since the timing was wrong. Leonard proposed to Martinez only 14 days after the couple’s first child was born. She explained in a TikTok follow-up:</p><p>“He proposed barely two weeks later, the day after Valentine’s Day, and I thought, ‘This is really lovely, but now isn’t the time.'” I’m still quite hormonal. I’m in the throes of postpartum depression.'”</p><p>She went on to say:</p><p>“In addition, our relationship was still not in the ideal shape. We had a lot to work out, a lot to speak about, and I didn’t want an engagement and marriage simply because we had a kid. I wanted it to be something unique, something we both felt compelled to do for one other. It’s just the two of us.”</p><p>Martinez’s life altered once they went to couple’s counseling and had their second kid. She was prepared to say yes to his proposition the following time. She stated:</p><p>“We have two children, we’ve worked through a lot in couple’s therapy, and now I’m ready to say yes.””<br>And when Leonard got down on his knees again and proposed to his lady love, an elated Martinez promptly answered “yes.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiroZ1dl66ktMSlpqtlo6mus3nBnqKaoF2irrPAyKecs2WXpMFusc2gmKCdlGLBsHnHnqlmpJ%2BjtG7AyKacZpqfrrOztcSnm2afopbGtMDOp2SlnZ%2BjrrOwjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
