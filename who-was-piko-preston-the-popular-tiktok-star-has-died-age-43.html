He gave everything to everyone. He was our family peacemaker and always mediated sibling disagreements while we were growing up and continued to do his best to make everyone around him happy every single day of his life. If Jon was around you were guaranteed to laugh. He was the most fun uncle to my children and each of my girls has a special connection with him even though we live so far apart. He recently began a TikTok account where his beautiful smile, wicked sense of humor, and impeccable comedic timing made his one million followers laugh on a daily basis. We love you so much Jon-Jon. I am so glad I got one last hug when we visited in June. We will all do our best to be more giving and loving to honor your example.
