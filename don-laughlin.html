He was&nbsp;a native of Owatonna, Minnesota, and&nbsp;spent his teenage years as a fur trapper. He collected the money and invested it in gambling machines&nbsp;installed in hunting lodges.</p><p>He had earned $500 a week when his principal issued an ultimatum: get out of slots or get out of school. He decided to drop out of school. Laughlin moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, in the late 1950s and opened his first casino, the “101 Club.”</p><p>Laughlin, on the other hand, had left the 101 Club by 1964. During the same period, Laughlin delighted at the expanding construction along the Colorado River when flying his private plane over the tri-state region of California, Arizona, and Nevada.</p><h2>About Don Laughlin’s Riverside Resort Hotel & Casino</h2><p>Laughlin paid $250,000 for an abandoned riverbank motel spanned 6.5 acres (2.6 hectares). The resort experienced a major expansion in 1972, giving rise to the<span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Riverside Resort Hotel & Casino</a></span>, which had 48 extra rooms at first.</p><p>1983, a 14-story hotel/casino tower was constructed, adding 253 rooms. Two years later, in 1986, a second 14-story tower was built, adding 307 additional rooms and an automotive museum.</p><p>The Riverside is a branch of the renowned <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Harrah’s collection</a></span> and offers free public entry to its vast collection. A classic display, a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro known as<span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> “Big Red”</a></span> that was customized for road racing was brought back into service and featured on the cover of<span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Hot Rod Magazine’s May 2005</a></span> issue.</p><p>The biggest addition, which brought the total to 1405 rooms, was made in 1994 when 800 more rooms were added in 1999; this is one of Laughlin’s two bowling alleys. Additionally, Laughlin contributed to funding the building of a bridge that spans the <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Colorado River</a></span> and connects the northernmost point of Laughlin with the <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Laughlin-Bullhead International Airport.</a></span></p><p>Remarkably, the public can still view Riverside’s large collection, which draws inspiration from the esteemed Harrah’s collection for free. His contributions played a great role, and he earned fame and respect throughout his career.</p><p>Laughlin will always be remembered, and he will be dearly missed. Thoughts and Condolences to his family, friends, and community. Prayers for him; may he get peace hereafter. Rest in Peace, Don Laughlin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7trzTqKqpnZWZt7DB0aeYpaGjonuku8xopZ6vo2SxsLqMpZiun5ihtq97</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
