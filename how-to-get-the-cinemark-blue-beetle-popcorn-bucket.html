After visiting our Cinemark location this weekend to check on that popcorn bucket again, an employee let me know that thereâ€™s a website where some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">movie merch will be available for purchase</a>; so be sure to keep your eyes peeled there, too.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>What is Blue Beetle about?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>The upcoming superhero film will soon be taking us on a grand adventure, but just what is Blue Beetle about?
