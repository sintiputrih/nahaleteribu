Whenever they are asked to comment on Reid or his ethics on and off the court, players become extra cautious, exhibiting the kind of discipline they are made to follow within the squad.</p><p>Well, recently, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Chiefs</a> Tight End Travis Kelce, along with his brother Jason Kelce, made a request to Mahomes asking him to approach the HC for an episode in their podcast New Heights. Apparently, the quarterback refused to escalate this forward, and the reason he was terrified.</p><p>“Do you mind asking him for us? Travis Kelce is too shy,” Jason asked Mahomes on Twitter. Soon the passer replied, saying, “Not going to lie I’m terrified as well,”. Well, not a surprise anymore because Mahomes had previously mentioned his experience when Andy Reid nodded for the State farm commercial.</p><p>“I made State Farm ask him first because I was scared,” Mahomes <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>said</a>. However, Mahomes revealed that Reid happens to be a cool guy with a soft heart inside.</p><p>“Once they asked him, he kind of came to me and asked me if I wanted him to do it. Obviously, I did because I know how much personality he has. … People don’t see it,” he explained.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-nfl-news-patrick-mahomes-set-to-miss-out-on-crucial-offensive-weapon-for-4-games?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022-10-03T021711Z_729924652_MT1USATODAY19168460_RTRMADP_3_NFL-KANSAS-CITY-CHIEFS-AT-TAMPA-BAY-BUCCANEERS-453x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Patrick Mahomes Set to Miss Out on Crucial Offensive Weapon for 4 Games</p></a><p>Not to mention, Mahomes and his head coach nailed the commercial with crazy dialogues and antics that invoked laughter among the viewers.
