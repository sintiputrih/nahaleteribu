Eagle-eyed fans with bad or disillusioned intentions seem to be lurking around every corner, and it's not uncommon for a celebrity to require assistance in safeguarding themselves from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an obsessed fan</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While most fans maintain normal respect boundaries, some engage in scary behaviors, such as breaking and entering, stalking, and misguided intentions to harm or "be with" the celebrity they are obsessed with. There are a few stars that have had such close encounters with obsessed fans that restraining orders have been put in place to secure their protection.</p><h2 id=billie-eilish><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Billie Eilish</span></h2><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billie Eilish</a> </strong>rose to fame at a very young age, and it didn't take long for the downfalls of superstardom to catch up with her. Being in the spotlight resulted in a crazed fan getting a tad too obsessed with the artist, and somehow he was not only able to access her home, but decided to show up there multiple times, vying for Eilish's attention.</p><p>In 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eilish wasted no time getting a restraining order </a>against 24-year-old Prenell Rousseau of Farmingville, New York. Reports reveal, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was banned "from attempting to contact or coming within 100 yards</a> (91 meters) of the pop star or her parents."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Did Brad Pitt Really Have A Restraining Order Against Leonardo DiCaprio?</a></span></p><h2 id=usher><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Usher</span></h2><p>We've heard of obsessed and delusional fans before, but Usher seems to have found himself the very definition of an eerie stalker. He's unfortunately had many run-ins with&nbsp;Darshelle Jones-Rakestraw, who showed up unexpectedly at his home back in 2012 claiming to be his wife.</p><p>He successfully executed a restraining order against her, only to find himself back in the same predicament with her, two years later. She even tried to extort money from Usher and wound up facing arrest.</p><h2 id=ariana-grande><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ariana Grande</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Grande's stalker</a> is a frightening man by the name of&nbsp;Fidel Henriquez, who at the age of 20, appeared at Ariana's Los Angeles home with a backpack over his shoulders. In that bag were notes and items that insinuated he was there to murder the famous star. Of course, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana</a></strong> was afraid for her safety, and Fidel was arrested and swiftly slapped with a restraining order.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He was&nbsp;issued a permanent restraining order that is valid until 2025 and keeps him at least 100&nbsp;yards away from Ariana, her mother, their property, and their vehicles.</p><h2 id=halle-berry><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Halle Berry</span></h2><p>Halle Berry's stalking troubles date back to 2011, She became frightened and fed up enough with Richard A. Franco to take the matter to the courts. TMZ reports that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Franco was so obsessed with Halle</a> that he scaled a massive wall that surrounds her property and attempted to break into her guest house. Berry filed a three year restraining order against him, keeping him away from herself and her daughter, Nahla.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bachelor Nation: Reality Steve Sides With Cassie On Restraining Order Against Colton, ‘Scary Stuff’</a></span></p><h2 id=gwyneth-paltrow><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Gwyneth Paltrow</span></h2><p>In 2014, Gwyneth Paltrow successfully enacted a permanent restraining order against crazed fan,&nbsp;Nickolaos Gavrilis. To say that he was a threat to her and her family would be a severe understatement, considering this obsessive fan repeatedly tried breaking and entering into not just one of her homes, but two of them... in completely different regions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nickolaos attempted to gain entry into Paltrow's United States and United Kingdom residences, and since he's made efforts to enter her personal space on both sides of the Atlantic, it's safe to say the permanent restraining order was necessary!</p><h2 id=justin-timberlake><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Justin Timberlake</span></h2><p>It was back in 2009 that Justin Timberlake had to seek refuge from a person being described as being an "obsessed and mentally unstable fan." He was successfully able to obtain a permanent restraining order against Karen McNeil, who was caught trespassing and caused a disturbance at his property.</p><p>Media reports indicate that she also had a note in her hand, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed to be "good friends" with JT</a>. Further probing revealed she also had a restraining order against her by Axl Rose, who experienced the same level of annoyance and unwanted visits&nbsp;by McNeil.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bella-hadid><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Bella Hadid</span></h2><p>Bella Hadid was stunned when&nbsp;Brian Perez began appearing at her Manhattan apartment and then going on to her social media channels threatening to enter her building. These haunting messages were enough to make anyone worry, but as he persisted and displayed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stalker behavior</a>, Bella Hadid recalled actually seeing him outside her residence. Clearly coming too close for comfort, and expressing bizarre stalking behaviors, Bella wasted no time in obtaining a restraining order to keep this crazy fan away from her.</p><h2 id=selena-gomez><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Selena Gomez</span></h2><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Selena Gomez</a></strong> had a crazed stalker who presented very dangerous traits and wasted no time getting a restraining order against him for his horrifying behavior. This all began when&nbsp;Thomas Brodnicki told his therapist that "God" sent him to kill Gomez. Sources reveal, he then went on to state that&nbsp;"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Selena Gomez and I are the holy chosen ones of God.</a> I'm not overly concerned if I meet (Selena) in the flesh because it may be like scripture says ... 'No man has seen the face of God'... Maybe us being together is too much like seeing the face of God." Not only was Gomez able to obtain a restraining order, but Brodnicki was also locked into a psychiatric hospital in Los Angeles to receive assistance and monitoring.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kendall Jenner & Other Celebs Who Have Dealt With Stalkers</a></span></p><h2 id=rihanna><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Rihanna</span></h2><p>In 2013, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna</a></strong> realized she had a crazed fan on her hands when her neighbor's house was broken into by Steveland Barrow, who thought he had gained entrance into Rihanna's home. Barrow not only broke into her neighbor's home, but he also fell asleep in a bed that he truly believed to be Rihanna's, and stole some items from the house. She was quick to obtain a restraining order against him. As if that isn't a creepy enough story already, when he was released from custody, he completely disappeared.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Taylor Swift</span></h2><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift</a></strong> has had a few run-ins with crazed fans, but this particular stalking encounter was a horrifying one. Julius Sandrock was caught breaking into her Beverly Hills mansion while wearing a mask and gloves. Even more disturbing was the fact that reports show he had "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">live ammunition, latex gloves, rope and multiple types of masks in his car</a>." In a creepy admission of guilt, when Sandrock was arrested, he told police he suffered from "OCD, bipolar disorder, severe depression and manic episodes. He also allegedly divulged he'd recently gotten divorced, and Taylor's music helped him through it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Celebrity Stalkers Who Went Too Far</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZoqScnrJusciloKygXZa%2Fqq3NmmSgqpGjsaZ5wKebZnBdpMGpsdFmqq2Zoqh6uLTOZp%2BanF2pvG6yyKWcZqqVqMGzrcinoKefXaS%2FpbHRrGSan5Geu7TAjJypmrKVmXqnrc2sZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
