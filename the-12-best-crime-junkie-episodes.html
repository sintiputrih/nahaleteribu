Scott Peterson, her husband, was found guilty of murdering her and remains in prison despite his protestations of innocence. Both episodes open with a recap of the events leading up to Laci’s disappearance. The hosts paint a vivid image of Laci and the frantic search after she disappeared during a stroll around the park.

Keyes presented himself as a businessman, a war hero, and a father, all hallmarks of everyday existence. However, he lived a double life full of evil behind this mask. After his arrest for the murder of Samantha Koenig in 2012, the full scope and planning of his crimes became apparent.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=659 data-current-count=1051 data-injectable=true>Keyes would prepare “kill kits” across the country, often years before he intended to use them, containing money, guns, and disposal equipment. Since he randomly picked his victims, authorities had difficulty linking his acts. The abduction and murder of Samantha Koenig, detailed by Ashley and Brit, is just one of the horrifying atrocities Keyes admitted to doing. The hosts deftly dissect Keyes’ statements to the police, exposing the cold calculation behind the serial killer’s actions. They also discuss the aftermath of Keyes’ suicide in prison, where many concerns remain unresolved regarding the full scope of his crimes.</p><p data-characters=61 data-current-count=61 data-injectable=false>Listen to the full podcast of this Crime Junkie episode on:&nbsp;</p><ul data-current-count=133.5 data-injectable=false><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple Podcasts</a></li><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a></li><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pandora</a></li></ul><h2 id=h-murdered-lindsay-buziak-episode-58 data-injectable=false>Murdered: Lindsay Buziak (episode 58)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lindsay-Buziak.jpg><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>Lindsay Buziak, a young real estate agent from British Columbia, was brutally killed in 2008 after being lured to a home showing in Saanich.

But Ashley and Brit explore the many conspiracy theories of the crash. They look into every possible explanation, from mechanical failure to sabotage to assassination. They spin a fascinating tale, casting doubt on official conclusions and digging into the sources of persistent skepticism. The hosts strike a good mix between acknowledging the appeal of conspiracy ideas and rooting the conversation in what is known.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-murdered-the-watts-family-episode-81 data-injectable=false>Murdered: The Watts Family (episode 81)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/watts-family.jpg><p data-characters=476 data-current-count=776 data-injectable=true>This episode examines one of the most horrific acts of family annihilation in recent history: the brutal murders of Shanann Watts and her two young children, Bella and Celeste, by Shanann’s husband and the children’s father, Chris Watts.
