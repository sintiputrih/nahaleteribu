Her late mother-in-law Princess Diana herself selected the unusual sparkler – an oval, royal-blue sapphire – after Prince Charles proposed in 1981. It was from a selection of rings from the former Crown jewellers Garrard of Mayfair. "It's very special to me. As Kate's very special to me now, it was right to put the two together," William said on the day of their engagement announcement. "It was my way of making sure my mother didn't miss out on today and the excitement, and the fact that we're going to spend the rest of our lives together.” The stunning central stone is a 12-carat oval Ceylon sapphire, one of Princess Diana's favourite gemstones, while the 14 solitaire diamonds nestled around it are set in 18-carat white gold.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0fba85c30a61-kate-middleton-third-ring-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eDLPRcxXWeNet data-wc=15><strong>Kate's gold wedding band is made from the Royal family's collection of Welsh yellow gold</strong></p><p id=e6f2KLLVcMV45 data-wc=39>Kate's traditional gold wedding band sits neatly beside her engagement ring and was made from the Royal family's collection of Welsh yellow gold and is similar to the same worn by both the Queen Mother and Queen Elizabeth II.</p><p id=eUGfryIrF6RcT data-wc=31>Prince William gifted the mother of his children a diamond eternity band following the birth of Prince George.
