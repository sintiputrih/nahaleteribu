The shirtless guys relived their glory days, cringed at their past fashion choices, and looked hunkier than ever during a throwback photo shoot.</p><p>Baywatch star David Chokachi traded in his famous red swim trunks for some roughed-up jeans. The actor, 47, played Cody Madison on the drama from 1995 to 1999. Besides saving lives, he remembers scuba diving, beating up bad guys, and, oh yeah, making out with<strong> Pamela Anderson</strong> while in character. “I’m always like, ‘Damn, that was a good job!'” he mused.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>While Chokachi was busy at the beach, Ziering, 51, was walking the hallways of West Beverly Hills High School — in the preppiest clothes ever! “I look back at some of those outfits and think, ‘What was it that influenced me to button my dress shirts to the top button?’” he said of playing Steve Sanders, laughing. “Because every time I see it it’s so ridiculous!” (Ziering recently displayed his buff bod during Chippendales shows, or as his daughter says, he “pops his shirt off!”)</p><p>By contrast, Lawrence, 39, didn’t seem to mind his Blossom wardrobe as much. The still-dreamy former child actor even thinks that Joey Russo’s red flannel look is making a comeback. (Whoa!) “Nowadays I’m feeling like I’m seeing it all over again. Flannels around the waist are back!” he told <strong>Us</strong>, calling out<strong> Johnny Depp </strong>and <strong>Kanye West’s</strong> latest garb. He added of the TV classic starring Mayim Bialik: “It feels long ago because so much has happened since 1996, but yet it feels like it was yesterday too.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Sabato Jr., meanwhile, often donned a clean-shaven face on soaps like General Hospital and Bold and the Beautiful. He was also the eye candy who cavorted with <strong>Janet Jackson </strong>in her 1989 “Love Will Never Do (Without You)” music video. (Dude can work a wife-beater!)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>But enough with the fashion jibber-jabber! After all, the men stripped down for <strong>Us</strong>, showing off their rock-hard abs and chiseled physiques. In fact, it’s as if no one has aged at all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Sabato Jr.’s daughter Mina, however, may disagree! “We were on YouTube and she saw some of the episodes from General Hospital,” the 43-year-old told<strong> Us</strong>, joking: “She said, ‘Who’s that!?'”</p><p>For more on the actors’ favorite memories, what their kids think of their careers, and more, watch the swoon-worthy video above. (Over and over again!)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGZyaKNitba6yqxko6eVrnqtrdarnKeblWK2orqMs6CeqpmjtG6t0Z5koaekqbKzedOhmKdllauys3nVopuep11nfXKBkWpsaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
