It’s weird. I definitely feel ashamed and embarrassed over a lot of the stuff, old clips, that started coming out when I got cancelled,” he said.</p><p>“All of that. Awful. Then it snowballed. If I talk about it how I really feel, people are going to say ‘oh you’re trying to get sympathy.’ I feel like people are going to hate me no matter what, and I kind of just have to accept it,” he continued, going on to walk through discussing his “cancellation” with his therapist.</p><p>“I went through a weird time when I wanted to leave the Internet. I felt like it ruined my life…I feel like I shouldn’t talk about this, whatever…here’s what I’ll say. I’m very disconnected from the person I was in my early 20s to a point where when I see that person, it makes me feel really sad and sick to my stomach. Some things I learned over the last year and a half, I can’t just pretend like that person didn’t exist, so I’ve really come to peace with that. I don’t want to get too much into this, but I made a lot of growth before I got cancelled,” he went on to say.</p><p>“I felt like I got to a place where I was proud of what I was making on YouTube, proud of who I was becoming…and then it felt like everything spiraled and I got cancelled, and then it felt like the end of the world…it lasted months. I think part of me was upset because I made so much growth, and now I’m being cancelled over things in the past, and that’s not me anymore…it made me realize that I can’t focus on what other people think of me…I learned a lot. I’m so happy it happened. So grateful I got cancelled, because it really changed my life.”</p><p>“I’m happy sitting in this weird, dark living room with him watching candle reviews. That makes me happy. And I want to make movies. And I want to get creative again, but those aren’t at the top of my priority list,” he said.</p><p>“I don’t want that to be the thing I’m constantly bringing up…it would be unhealthy for me to constantly think about it. I love life again. I love leaving the house…I just met a lot of really great people who said a lot of nice things.”</p><p>He went on to explain that he is interested in making horror movies in the next chapter of his life, and that he is feeling inspired again in his new home.</p><p><a href=#>He recently made a cameo in a video from</a> <a href=# title="Jeffree Star"><strong>Jeffree Star</strong></a>.</p><p>Watch his video…</p><p></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Justjared.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toq5iWu6Z5w5qurKeeYr%2BmwNSrpaxlpKR6urvUraybnV2WsaW%2BxKyqnqtdnba0ecKapZydnKGutbXOp2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
